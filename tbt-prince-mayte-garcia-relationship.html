Grammy-winning musician and icon Prince, who passed away at the age of 57 in 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How They Met:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Garcia was 16, she and her family were visiting Spain and decided to see Prince in concert. Her parents encouraged her to send Prince a tape of herself belly dancing, but she resisted. Two weeks later, the musician played a venue near where she lived (in Germany) and Garcia's mom slipped a tape of her daughter's routines to one of his backup dancers. "Five minutes later, I met him," Garcia said in a video for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>VH1's Hollywood Exes</a>. They remained friends for the next two years at a distance, exchanging <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>letters</a> and videos ( "Maybe we could fly away 2 Jupiter, I hear the food is good there"), and then Prince invited her to join his team.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prince <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>later told Oprah Winfrey</a> he remembered thinking "that's my future wife" when he first saw the dancer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Garcia said she couldn't "really pinpoint when [the relationship] became romantic," but she did tell the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Irish Times</a> that when she was 19, Prince told her "it was time" for her to go on birth control.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was a 'finally!' moment," Garcia remembered. "I mean, the flirtation . . . I was 19. I was ready."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pete Still/Redferns</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prince was won over by, uh … coincidence? As he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, Garcia's middle name was Janelle and his father's name was John L; Garcia's mother's name was Nell and Prince was born Prince Rogers Nelson. "Nell's son,'' he told the publication. ''Am I going to argue with all these coincidences?'' Apparently not.'</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">'She really makes my soul feel complete," he continued. "I feel powerful with her around. And she makes it easier to talk to God.''</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple ultimately <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wed on Valentine's Day in Minneapolis in 1996</a>, six years after they first met.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marrying Prince was something of a childhood dream for Garcia, who was 9 years old <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>when she told her mother</a> "I'm going to marry Prince or Luis Miguel. One of the two."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> By Garcia's account, everything you'd imagine about marrying a living legend sounds ... well, true.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Right off the bat, things were extravagant. As a wedding gift, Prince gave his bride a 7,500 square-foot <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>mansion in Spain</a>, complete with a professional hair salon and music studio. In her 2017 memoir, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>The Most Beautiful: My Life With Prince</a>, Garcia recalled shopping guerilla-style with Prince, a method she referred to as "fast and plenty."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of, you know, comparing prices and trying things on, the couple would hit Melrose (in a limo, of course) and storm in and out of each store before anyone could notice that American royalty was within eyeshot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They'd "scope out the coolest clothes, grab whatever we want, and hand it to security on the way out." There was "no time to check out price tags," but who needs to when the entire world knows you by just one name (er, symbol … ).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prince was convinced that he and Garcia had known each other in a past life. In 1996 he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Oprah</a> that he felt as though his wife "was either my sister or we were the same person or something in another life." Though the talk show host balked at the idea, suggesting that it was "kind of weird," Prince stood his ground. "There's a closeness there that you know is right and you don't argue with," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Together we explored universes and lifetimes and universal truth," Garcia later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>wrote in her memoir</a>. She noted that the musician thought their souls may have crossed paths in Egypt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My soul has been in love with [my wife] Mayte for thousands of years," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince told Spike Lee</a> in 1997. When asked to elaborate (because of course), he added, "I am a firm believer in reincarnation for people who either have more work to do or have so much debt to pay back that they have to be here. I hope for me it is the former, and my work was finding Mayte and having a child, which we will continue to work on until there are several here."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SINEAD LYNCH/AFP via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Garcia revealed</a> that the combination to the late singer's music vault was her measurements.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But not everything was mansions and vaults and past lives … Garcia (thankfully) divulged that Prince also enjoyed life's simple pleasures, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tostitos</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah interview</a>, Garcia admitted that she didn't (and never had) called her husband by his name, Prince.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I met him, I didn't call him Prince," she explained. "I never called him that, because I didn't see him as that person."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People always say, 'but what if you need him to bring you something — pass the tea or something?" Good question. "I just say 'hey.'</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For that, The Artist was grateful. "I would drop the tea if I heard 'Prince' come from the kitchen," he joked. "[It would] scare me to death."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hilarity of this dynamic aside, the couple's true peak came with the release of "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," a song dedicated to Garcia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two months into their marriage, Garcia got pregnant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From the beginning, doctors warned of complications and encouraged the couple to get an amniocentesis test, but Prince refused medical interference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Prince and Garcia welcomed their son, Amiir, in Oct. 1996, he was born with a genetic disorder called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pfeiffer Syndrome Type II,</a> which can result in the fusion of bones, protrusion of eyes, and breathing problems.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After six days and several procedures to aid his breathing, Amiir tragically passed away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't think he ever got over it," Garcia told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> of Prince's reaction to the death. "I don't know how anybody can get over it. I know I haven't."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple attempted to keep the tragedy out of the press, but the media kept digging. The couple's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah interview</a> took place just weeks after Amiir had passed away, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Prince told Garcia not to mention their son</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Winfrey pried, asking about the "status" of their baby, Prince said, "Our family exists. We're just beginning it. We've got many kids to have." When the host addressed the rumors regarding the child, Prince insisted, "it's all good," adding, "never mind what you hear."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Garcia got pregnant again following Amiir's death, but she suffered a miscarriage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think that's what drove us apart," Garcia said in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ABC News</a>. "I think he thought because we lost our two children, two babies, that I wasn't the one."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prince's decision to become a Jehovah's Witness divided the couple further.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was hard core into it," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Garcia wrote in her memoir.</a> "I could not go there with him, no matter how hard he tried to make me see that path."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Irish Times</a> that she thought Prince's fixation on religion was a product of the couple's devastating loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My belief is when something happens so tragic in your life, you can become very vulnerable and you can be open to many things, and I'm not saying religion is bad – in the book I tried to be as loving as possible – but it is what it is."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1998, Prince announced in a press conference that he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>planned to annul his marriage</a> to Garcia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I remember being devastated, shocked," Garcia told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Irish Times</a>. "I know that he would go through little phases of certain things. I was hoping he'd snap out of it for sure. I never thought that I wouldn't be around."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After having the Prince write top 40 poetry about her, Garcia found it difficult to date other musicians.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All the songs he wrote for me, that's a pretty hard act to follow," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Mirror</a>. "I've dated a couple of guys, musicians, who have written me poems or songs and I'm like, 'Seriously, don't even go there.
