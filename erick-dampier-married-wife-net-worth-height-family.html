Happy 43rd Birthday Erick Dampier! He was an early entry to the 1996 NBA draft after his junior season, in which he led MSU to the 1996 Southeastern Conference tournament championship, and the NCAA Final Four before being drafted as the tenth pick in the first round by the Indiana Pacers. He played 72 games in his rookie year with the Pacers, starting 21 of them and finishing with averages of 5.1 points and 4.1 rebounds per game. On August 12, 1997 he and Duane Ferrell were traded to the Golden State Warriors for Chris Mullin. He spent the next seven years, primarily as the starting center, for the Warriors, hitting his peak production in 2003–04 with averages of 12.3 points, 12 rebounds and 1.85 blocks per game. However, some critics claimed that he stepped up his production because he was in a contract year, and indeed he was considered a top free-agent commodity in the 2004 off-season. On August 24, 2004, Dampier was signed and traded to the Dallas Mavericks along with Dan Dickau, Evan Eschmeyer and rights to Steve Logan in exchange for Christian Laettner, Eduardo Nájera, 2 future first round picks and rights to Luis Flores and Mladen Sekularac. In his first season in Dallas he played in 59 games (starting 56), averaging 9.2 points, 8.5 rebounds and 1.85 blocks per game. #JesusIsComing #JesusSaves #TeamJesus #ErickDampier #MissST #Warriors #GSW #GoldenStateWarriors #OracleArena #NorCal #EastBay #MississippiState #SneakerNews #NiceKicks #SoleCollector #Maranatha #116 #1975 #Romans116 #John316 #NBA #FIBA #Unashamed #EndTimes #ChristIsKing #ReignIsComing #WakeUp #YHWH</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">RetroRoundball Until Rapture</a> (@thisdayinhoops) on Jul 14, 2018 at 10:58am PDT</p><p>Moving onto his educational qualification, he studied at Lawrence Country High School in Monticello, Mississippi.
