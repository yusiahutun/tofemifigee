The star </span><a href=#><span>Rico León</span></a><span> will also be aided by a team of experts including designer Pam Moore and chief estimator Matt Plowman.</span></p><p><span>So, who’s Pam? Keep reading this Pam Moore Bio to learn all about her.</span></p><h3><b>Pam Moore On HGTV Rico to the Rescue</b></h3><p><span>Pam Moore is the designer on </span><i><span>Rico to the Rescue</span></i><span> who will be helping the titular star aid a lot of Colorado families having trouble with renovations. But it seems, Pam wouldn’t just be helping Rico to analyze what’s gone wrong in construction projects, but also help him to bring some much-needed diversity to the HGTV show. The designer holds Indian roots in case you didn’t know.</span></p><p><i><span>Heavy </span></i><span>stated that when </span><i><span>Rico to the Rescue</span></i><span> premieres, Rico will become HGTV’s only Latino host. Also, they mentioned that 37 primetime shows premiered or returned on HGTV between January 1 and August 31, 2022. That added up to 370 new TV episodes airing on the network during that time — more than any other traditional cable network — yet there were zero Latino on-air leads or co-leads and zero Latino showrunners or directors.</span></p><p><span>Indeed it was surprising that such a&nbsp; popular channel failed to incorporate any Latinos into their shows.</span></p><p><span>For those who can’t wait, in the premiere ep, Pam and her team will meet a distressed couple who are more than a year into their unfinished renovations with a contractor. And thanks to it, the relationship has turned nasty! Upset with the builder’s poor communication and project management skills, Rico will attempt to mediate the situation — but with no success!</span></p><p><span>According to Rico, he aims to be an advocate for families who desperately need someone with empathy and experience to “turn the construction nightmare into a dream home.” He future explained that whenever got a call for help, his goal was to resolve the conflict between the homeowner and the home builder and to go above and beyond to complete the project.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Pam Moore Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Pam Moore flaunted a net worth of above $1 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span>This designer has been in the industry for over 17 years!

And this was also what set them apart from others — their art form. Be it of any budget or taste, their designs were unparalleled.</span></p><p><span>Their services include Kitchen Interior Design & Remodel, Bathroom Interior Design & Remodel, Basement Interior Design & Build Out, Remodel & Renovations Design to Build Out, Carpeting Selection & Installation, Cabinetry/Closets, Professional Installation, Hardwood Flooring, and so on.</span></p><p><span>You can also shop their Accessories, Chandeliers, Furshishing, Lamps, Mirrors, and Pendants online at “poonamsbydesign.com.”</span></p><h3><b>Pam Moore Age</b></h3><p><span>Pam Moore was 44 years of age when </span><i><span>Rico to the Rescue</span></i><span> was all set to go.</span></p><h3><b>Is Pam Moore Married?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, as of 2022, Pam Moore is married to her husband Everett Moore for over 26 years.
