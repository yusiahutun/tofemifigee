However, the two are half-siblings.</span></p><p><span>She was born to parents, Barry E and Amy C Eisenberg (born: Mar 1954). Reportedly, her dad and mom got married in 1977 when they were both 23. Sadly, they divorced soon after and Kerri’s dad went on to marry Jesse’s mother Amy Fishman (who is very close to Kerri).</span></p><p><span>Jesse then arrived in this world on October 5, 1983. And then arrived Kerri’s little sister Hallie Eisenberg (born: Aug 2, 1992). This means Hallie turned 27 in 2019.

She wrote, “My #oneandonly #starfucker moment… my brother #jesseeisenberg.”</span></p><p><span>Now, talking in detail about Kerri’s biological mother, Amy is very supportive of her daughter. She was even there on the set of </span><i><span>Scene Steale</span></i><span>r to support Kerri and take care of her dog while she was acting. “Mom- thank you for being there for Krishna and me… it was so so so great to see you and we miss you so much already and all the time,” Kerri thanked her mother later on IG.</span></p><p><span>Also, In July 2016, she dedicated an IG post to her. It read, “She saves my life every day, makes me laugh, taught me what it’s like to feel loved, and understood things about me that no one else on this planet ever could.”</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Kerri’s sister Hallie is the Pepsi Girl from the late ’90s and early ’00s commercials.
