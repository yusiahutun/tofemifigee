Valentine’s Day is on Tuesday, so dive into the sweet lightheartedness and leave the seriousness on the back-burner for now.</p><p>An overly sensitive conjunction between <a href=#>love planet Venus</a> and thoughtful&nbsp;Neptune in Pisces&nbsp;hits you over the head with its soul-stirring downpour of emotion on Wednesday. Your fragile feelings are easily smashed to bits by mean people midweek, so you’ll have to take some serious precautions to make sure you don’t get crushed under the weight of just trying to exist.</p><p>On Friday, luckily, there’s a helpful sextile between quick-thinking&nbsp;Mercury and <a href=#>expansive&nbsp;Jupiter</a> that brings better people into your life. Working as part of a team over the weekend gets the job done quickly/efficiently and makes the time go by so much faster than if you had to take all this on alone.</p><p>There’s more dreamy, indecisive Pisces energy on Saturday as both the dazzling&nbsp;sun enters Pisces&nbsp;and <a href=#>a new&nbsp;moon</a> will also be influenced by this idealistic sign. This means that you’ll spend a lot of time hoping and wishing things were different but won’t have the energy to actually do anything about it. Escaping into a dream world is nice for a while, but you have to snap out of it eventually, at which point reality is going to truly suck.</p><p>Things heat up on Sunday, though, when passionate Venus partners with fire sign&nbsp;Aries&nbsp;and brings another intense and exciting escape route. Things happen quickly now, whether you’re ready for them or not. This is a very “me, me, me” transit, so get ready to focus on yourself for a while. What do you&nbsp;really&nbsp;want? It’s time to go out there and get it.</p><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><h2 class=hide-small><strong>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>As we get closer to the end of winter, you’re hunkering down and getting stuck in your own mind when the sun enters Pisces on Saturday.
