heard.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But she now claims 'she has no assets whatsoever' in order to repay her victims.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The

victims that the cash they gave her would be hung from a 'magical tree' deep in the Amazonian rainforest by shamans 'Pa' and 'Oma', according to ancient healing rites.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Police say the fake mystic was paid at least £1million in cash but probably made more than £5million from the criminal enterprise.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She spent up to £1.5m on flights, antique furniture, Louis Vuitton handbags and rent on multiple flats in Hampstead, as well as a pet monkey later found it one of her
