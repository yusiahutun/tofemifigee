While the former couple didn’t personally divulge many details about the reason behind their split, it seems Bonet may have been dropping some subtle hints about the decision in an interview published just weeks before their announcement.</p><p>Bonet—who secretly tied the knot with Momoa in 2017 after more than a decade together—shares daughter Lola and&nbsp; son Nakoa-Wolf with the Aquaman star. The former couple announced their split in January 2022. In an <a href=# rel=nofollow>Interview</a> magazine feature published exactly a month before the pair revealed that they were going their separate ways, Bonet revealed that she was being called to pursue “new” things and learn to be “authentically” herself.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jason-momoa-lisa-bonet-lenny-kravitz.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/jason-momoa.jpg><p>When asked by&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;actress Marisa Tomei if anything was “calling” to her, the&nbsp;Cosby Show&nbsp;alum replied, “Definitely learning how to be authentically me, learning to be new, and following this invitation from the universe to step into this river of uncertainty. We’ve eliminated all this extra noise, and now it’s time to grow our roots deeper into our own values.”</p><p>Bonet went on to echo comments made in her announcement post with Momoa, noting that she felt the “squeeze” of the times we’re living in today. “The revolution is definitely here and we’re all feeling the squeeze. If you aren’t, you’re in total denial, and the more you resist, the more you will suffer,” Bonet said. “Everything is crumbling out there. The personal work is understanding where empire and those archetypes live within us. The revolution is on the inside, and learning to be new in this new world.”</p><p>On January 12, 2021, <a href=#>Momoa and Bonet</a> released a joint statement announcing their separation with <a href=# rel=nofollow>a post</a> on the&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;star’s Instagram account. “We have all felt the squeeze and changes of these transformational times … A revolution is unfolding ~and our family is of no exception … feeling and growing from the seismic shifts occurring,” their statement began. “And so~ We share our Family news~ That we are parting ways in marriage. We share this not because we think it’s newsworthy ~ But so that~ as we go about our lives we may do so with dignity and honesty.”</p><p>“The love between us carries on, evolving in ways it wishes to be known and lived,” their statement continued. “We free each other ~to be who we are learning to become…” The former couple ended their announcement with a note to their children Lola and Nakoa-Wolf. “Our devotion unwavering to this sacred life & our Children. Teaching our Children. What’s possible ~ Living the Prayer,” they wrote, adding, “May Love Prevail ✨ J & L.”</p><h2>Why did Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet break up?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jason-Momoa-Lisa-Bonet-2.jpg><p>Why did <a href=# id=auto-tag_jason-momoa data-tag=jason-momoa>Jason Momoa</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_lisa-bonet data-tag=lisa-bonet>Lisa Bonet</a> break up? A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> on January 18, 2022, that Bonet and Momoa’s break up wasn’t “overnight.” “[They] were amazing for years, until they no longer were,” the insider said. “They have grown apart because of different focuses.”</p><p>According to the insider, part of the reason for Momoa and Bonet’s split was the Aquaman star’s rising career.&nbsp;“A few years ago, Jason was struggling to find work. Now his career is booming. And he wants to keep working as much as he can,” the source said. The source went on to add that Bonet “has had no interest in joining” Momoa “on every location” he films at. The insider continued, “She enjoys her life in L.A.” The source also confirmed that distance was the main reason for Momoa and Bonet’s relationship ended. “It’s been difficult for them to be apart,” the insider said. “For some people, it might strengthen their marriage. For Lisa and Jason’s marriage, being apart has been a disaster.”</p><p>As for their kids, the source noted that Momoa and Bonet are “mature” and “will keep the peace” for the sake of their son and daughter. “It’s not going to be some scandalous divorce where they trash talk each other,” the source said. “They are both very spiritual and believe in a higher power.”</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> on January 19, 2022, that Momoa and Bonet’s different personalities was why their relationship worked until it drove them apart. “Jason and Lisa worked because they were so different,” the insider said. “He was jovial, loud and the center of attention, and Lisa was always cool, calm and subdued.” The source continued, “That energy really started to cause friction because they wanted to live different live. Jason wanted to travel and adventure much more. Lisa, she would rather read, write poetry and cook at home.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> also reported that Momoa and Bonet split due to the “different” directions in their lives.&nbsp;“Jason is very focused on his career and wants to work. He has found success and it’s driving him and is very fulfilling,” the insider said. “Lisa wants to be in LA and is not interested in going on location for long periods of time with him.”</p><p>According to the source, Bonet’s “priorities are different right now” and she is “very into” health and wellness. “That’s what motivates her.” Momoa, on the other hand “was moving in a different direction and it did not fit together with her lifestyle.” The insider continued, “They drifted apart and wanted different things.”</p><p>Despite their split, another source told People on January 19, 2022, that Momoa and Bonet still care “deeply about each other.” “They have been doing things separately for quite a while,” the insider said. “They were a great couple with a lot of love and respect for each other, but people change and goals change and they weren’t the same together anymore.” According to the insider, Momoa and Bonet started to grow apart before the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced them to be around each other and confront their relationship.&nbsp;“They have grown apart and the pandemic capped it,” the insider said. The source also noted that both Momoa and Bonet “want to explore other things” with other people and are ready to move on.</p><p>E! News’ source also revealed that Bonet is leaning on her daughter, Zoë Kravitz, amid her split from Momoa.&nbsp;“Zoë is very close to Lisa and will be of great support as she navigates through this,” the insider said. “She also really likes Jason and has a good relationship with him so it’s all very sad that this chapter is closing. She loves them both but understands that it was time for them to move on.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg alt="New Entertainment Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kW1ub3BiZMSpxYyjmKynnmK6sLnOmmSloaOWeqO7zZ6rZpqimq6sedSpZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./anne-hathaway-style.html>&#171;&nbsp;Anne Hathaway's Outfit Is Giving Andy Sachs</a>
