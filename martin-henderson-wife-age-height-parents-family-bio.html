Martin attended Birkenhead Primary School and received his high school education at Westlake Boys’ High School in Forrest Hill, Auckland, New Zealand.</p><p>He discovered his flair for acting at a young age when he left the stage of school performance. In his 4th grade, he made his official acting debut in Strangers, production for local television. When he played the role of Stuart Neilson in a television series called Shortland Street, Martin may not have seen it coming, but the series, which ran from 1992 to 1995, made him a local star. It also gave him greater opportunities.</p><p>He headed off to Australia, where he starred in Sweat and Echo Point and also met his young actor colleague Heath Ledger. The duo became friends, moved to Sydney, became housemates, and continued his acting career. Sadly, Heath died in 2008 at the age of 28 of cardiac arrest caused by drug poisoning. He won several prizes both alive and posthumously.</p><p>Martin received his first nomination for the 1999 film Kick in 2000 and in order to develop the acting skills he went to New York where he enrolled and took an acting and theater course. After a year (2000) without any acting roles, he got a supporting role in Windtalkers directed by John Woo. In 2005 he was cast in Bride & Prejudice and Little Fish, which later won several awards. Lovers of Grey’s Anatomy got to know his character Nathan Riggs and fell in love with him when he joined in season 12. Before that, he had worked on series like Off the Map (2011).</p><p>The New Zealand actor’s most recent work is the 2018 films: The Strangers: Loot at Night, Teenagers, and Hellbent. He is also known for his roles in Smokin’ Aces (2006), Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2007), Cedar Boys (2009), Devil’s Knot (2013), Everest (2015), and several others.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Is Cote De Pablo Married, What is She Doing Now?

He is said to have dated Marnette Patterson, an American actress who is now happily married to James Verzino and has two children with him. In 1994 it was said that Martin and Nicky Watson, also an actress, also had good times together. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Radha Mitchell, and Demi Moore were also supposedly friends of the good-looking actor.</p><p>At the end of last year (2017) he officially introduced Helen Randag as his “Bae” in an Instagram post. She is a film producer, director, author, and patron of the arts. Helen, who was previously married, also received the Prince Wales Medal for Arts Philanthropy in 2010, the youngest person ever to receive this award. Although the couple is still together, they have been unmarried since October 2018.</p><p>Martin was born the son of Veronica Henderson (his mother) and Ian Henderson (his father). There is not much information about them, but we know that they divorced when Martin was only five years old. His mother continued to support his goals and was there for him at a time when he wanted to quit. Martin has one brother, his only sibling. The actor is always proud of his background and accent, he always gives his upbringing the credit it deserves.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Martin Henderson Height</strong></h2><p>Martin has a muscular physique, he is 178 cm (5 feet 10 inches) tall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuqK%2B06KlZqCVo7GmvtKopWavmZuybq3GnmShnZmctbV5z5qpnqakqHqnrcyio7Jlkp68cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./queen-elizabeth-lilibet-astrology.html>&#171;&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth II &amp;amp; Lilibet Astrology: A Karmic Royal Connection</a>
