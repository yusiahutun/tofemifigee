Keep reading this Christine Whigham Bio to find out.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Christine Whigham, Shea Whigham Wife</b></h3><p><span>Christine Whigham married Shea Whigham back in 1995. So until now (as of 2023), the lovebirds have been together for over 27 years! Their secret? Love, understanding, communication, and bolognese. Yes, bolognese!</span></p><p><span>“My wife’s spaghetti bolognese. That’s my death row meal. If I’m dying and they come in, I want a nice Napa Cab and a spaghetti bolognese,” the actor explained.
