But considering he wasn’t at either home when federal agents stormed in, everyone is wondering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">where Diddy is</a>. The rapper hasn’t been publicly spotted since the day of the raids.</p><p>The same day of the raids, TMZ&nbsp;published&nbsp;a video of the rapper <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>pacing by himself outside the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport</a>, observing that he did not appear to be detained or in custody. His private jet—reportedly a LoveAir LLC Gulfstream G550—landed in Antigua without the rapper aboard. But <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>it’s no longer&nbsp;trackable</a>&nbsp;on FlightAware, a flight tracking website.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kesha-tik-tok-diddy_59a0f1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cassie-diddy-break-up.jpg><p>Regarding the raids on March 25, a spokesperson for Homeland Security Investigations told TMZ: “Earlier today, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York executed law enforcement actions as part of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>an ongoing investigation</a>, with assistance from HSI Los Angeles, HSI Miami, and our local law enforcement partners. We will provide further information as it becomes available.”</p><p>Local Los Angeles news station FOX11 shared a video that appeared to show several individuals in handcuffs near the property, two of them appearing to be&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Diddy’s sons, Justin and King Combs</a>. They were not being investigated in connection to their father’s alleged crimes but were being detained outside as agents searched the property. So <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">where’s Diddy</a>? Here’s what we know.</p><p>If you or someone you know has been a victim of sexual abuse, text “STRENGTH” to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected to a certified crisis counselor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-diddy>Where is Diddy?</h2><p>As mentioned, the last time <a href=# id=auto-tag_diddy data-tag=diddy>Diddy</a> was spotted publicly was by TMZ on Monday, just hours after the raids on his two homes in Los Angeles and Miami. “We’re told this shows Diddy pacing around outside a Customs office there at the airport—and as you can see—he’s not being detained, and he certainly doesn’t seem to be in custody here. Instead, Diddy is just walking around all by his lonesome,” the tabloid reported.</p><p>On March 27, the LA Times reported that the rapper “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>remains in the US</a>“, though didn’t add any more details. “Sources with knowledge of the situation said Combs was scheduled on Monday to depart by plane for a spring break vacation with his school-age daughters but opted to delay the trip after learning of the search. He still has his passport, they added,” the paper observed.</p><p>While his phone was said to be seized by the authorities, he returned to Instagram on Sunday to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>share a photo of his 1-year-old daughter, Love,</a>&nbsp;celebrating Easter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/diddy-homeland-security.jpg><p>The raids come after several allegations against the rapper were made. On November 16, 2023, Casandra Ventura, also known as R&B singer Cassie, filed a lawsuit in a New York federal court against Combs, whom she dated between 2005 and 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>She claimed he’d been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship, ranging from beating Ventura and forcing her to have sex with other men, to raping her at her home in 2018. They settled the next day, out of court.</p><p>“We have decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>resolve this matter amicably</a>. I wish Cassie and her family all the best. Love,” Combs said in a Friday statement obtained by CNN, with his lawyer adding: “A decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing,” Ben Brafman said. “Mr. Combs‘ decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.”</p><p>Diddy has been sued for sexual assault and harassment five times in four months, but he vehemently denies the claims. “There was a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>gross overuse of military-level force</a> as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs’ residences,” his attorney, Aaron Dyer, said Tuesday in a statement provided to Fox News Digital, in response to the raids.</p><p>“There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated. Mr. Combs was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/diddy-cassie.jpg><p>He continued: “Despite media speculation, neither Mr. Combs nor any of his family members have been arrested nor has their ability to travel been restricted in any way. This unprecedented ambush — paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence — leads to a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits,” he added.</p><p>Dyer concluded: “There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.”</p><p>Attorney Douglas Wigdor, who represents Ventura and an anonymous plaintiff referred to as Jane Doe, issued this statement, per ABC7, after the raids: “We will always&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>support law enforcement</a>&nbsp;when it seeks to prosecute those that have violated the law. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a process that will hold Mr. Combs responsible for his depraved conduct.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1ra3FiZMSpsdGeZKKrXZm2pbDYaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./june-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;19 Fun Facts About June</a>
