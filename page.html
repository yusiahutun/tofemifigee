well-deserved eye rolls that after 10 years of food blogging and one (now <a href=#>two</a>!) cookbook <a href=#><i>I had finally learned how to make coffee</i></a>. I mean, yeah, it was melodramatic. I, too, can scoop whatever the Maxwell House can says into the filter and press the on button, as I did most weekend mornings as a kid. What I meant was that I had figured out how to make the coffee I most liked to drink and spent too much money on at coffee shops these days, and I had found this delight with the simplest old-fashioned thing, a stovetop espresso maker.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5616 height=3744 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/06/crispy-spiced-lamb-and-lentil.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I made these lettuce cups on a whim for dinner last night and I’m so glad I did because I could see them going immediately into a regular rotation. I don’t know about you, but I think ground meat is underrated in the quick dinner category and am always looking for more things to do with it. This cooking technique, in which you flatten it out in a very hot pan and cook it until it’s browned and crisp on both sides, is like the best part of a <a href=#>Fake Shack Burger</a>, amped to 12. I’m pretty sure, like the time I discovered the <a href=#>crispy egg</a> and could not stop talking about it, I’m only going to want to cook it like this for now on.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4942 height=3293 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/06/grilled-pepper-and-torn-mozzarella-panzanella.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> This salad is not here to break the internet. Even among my friends, roasted sweet red peppers seem to be a perplexingly hard sell, although I hope all roasted pepper resistors are not basing their impressions on the jarred ones — those slippery things shouldn’t even rank. Because it’s the year 2017, I’m sure at least half of the people we know at any given time aren’t eating bread, so that’s not going to go over well either. I’m not sure why people — even my own father — loathe capers, but I bet I will soon find out. I understand that lots of people don’t like onions, even marinated and grilled lovelies, in salads. I know we all agree on mozzarella, at least.

For many years, I fiddled with ways to make cake layers thinner and thinner until I probably exasperated everyone, so it was just in the nick of time that I realized if I began with cookie-ish layers (say, <a href=#>soft macaroons</a> or <a href=#>icebox cookies the size of cakes</a>), and filled them with something fluffy that would soften them into “cakes” (whipped cream and its variants), it got easy enough that we could make them more often, which, after all, is the goal. Cookies aren’t limited by the number or size of your cake pans. Cookies can break and still stack into an excellent cake.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5275 height=3515 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/05/cacio-e-pepe-potatoes-anna.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe, Announcements</span></a> So, ahem [taps on microphone]… In the summer of 2014 <a href=#>I announced that I had not learned my lesson the first time and would be writing another cookbook</a>. My editor and agent told me the second book always goes faster; it’s like they didn’t think I’d rise to the challenge. <a href=#>This 2015 release</a> might have had some (tiny, adorable) effect on a rain-checked 2016 release, but as the <a href=#>first Smitten Kitchen Cookbook</a> approaches its 5th birthday, the wildest thing has happened: this second book I promised you is (at last) out of my hands and headed to the printers.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4596 height=3064 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/05/tall-fluffy-buttermilk-pancakes.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> About a year ago, over a series of weekends I was up too early anyway, I went on a buttermilk pancake-making bender. I tried, well, not all, but several of the recipes I always read about, the loftys and the fluffys and the best-evers. I used, in turn, cornstarch and vinegar and unseemly amounts of butter, I separated egg whites, I rested batters, and every single one of these pancakes was consumed by <a href=#>happy children</a> but not a-one of them stayed as tall as they left the pan for more than a few minutes and I was gravely disappointed. It was very possibly user error; all pancakes were made before 8:30 a.m. on weekends, pre-coffee. Regardless, I tabled it and moved on.<a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a> <a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4509 height=3006 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/05/rhubarb-upside-down-spice-cake.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I realize that spring is supposed to be all flowers and pastels, lightness and lemon zest, but all of these cool, rainy days in the last month make me crave winter spices, no matter how many tomatoes and herbs I have planted this week (so many, eee) in hopes, despite all historical evidence, that this is the year I excel at container gardening. And so when a teacher at my <a href=#>son’s</a> school brought me a bag of the most gorgeous, deeply red rhubarb (I really am this lucky), I knew immediately that this cake would have buttery, lightly caramelized stripe-y rhubarb topping draped over it. If you’re ever asking yourself if it’s been too long since you had an upside-down cake, the answer is always yes.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5076 height=3384 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/05/a-really-great-pot-of-chickpeas.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> A side-effect of doing this cooking thing for <a href=#>10+ years</a> is that people seem to imagine I’m so sort of domestic diva, eating only homemade bread and milling my own grains and not just someone with an obsessive streak when it comes to making things exactly the way she wants them. Even though I’d love to live in some alternate universe where I’d always have time and energy to make my own, I’m unbothered by frozen breaded chicken things (erm, occasionally), tortellini, boxed stocks, and canned beans; the freezer almost always contains the first two (lunchbox heroes!) and the cabinets, the latter, which is why when friend told me a couple weeks ago kind of sotto voce, almost like a confession, the other day that she’d never cooked her own dried beans, I couldn’t even rouse myself to gasp in faux <i>horreur</i>.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnxzgY4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./misha-anderson.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Misha Anderson dating?
