Then, he completed his college education in Paris, graduating with a certificate in Physical Education.</p><p>Wilfried migrated permanently to France later on and settled in Bondy, a suburb in the country’s capital, Paris.&nbsp;There, he set down roots and created a family that saw him become the father of three boys, Kylian and Ethan Mbappé, and an adopted son, Jires Kombo Ekoko.</p><p>Wilfried Mbappé’s career as a professional footballer was launched after he moved to France. He got to play for teams in the country’s regional leagues. However, he was unable to play for the country’s biggest teams.</p><p>After settling in Bondy, he started his managerial career as a coach in Bondy. He became quite popular in the town because he worked closely with talented kids to help them sharpen their skills.&nbsp;</p><p>He later joined AS Bondy, a famous club in the town. Wilfried worked there for 25 years and worked in various posts. After working there as a coach, he became the sporting director for the under-10s to under-17s.
