Having spent over a decade playing troubled young women in films such as Atonement, Killer Joe, Afternoon Delight and Unsane, Temple had effectively established herself as a dramatic actress who could tap into the darkness of a hard-knock life many times over. So, when the actor Jason Sudeikis asked her to read a comedy pilot that he had just written about an American college football coach who is recruited to coach an English Premier League soccer team, she assumed he had texted the wrong actress. But Sudeikis saw something in Temple that she, at the time, didn’t even see in herself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For three seasons on the hit Apple TV+ sports dramedy Ted Lasso, which premieres Wednesday, Temple has played Keeley Jones, an affable model and influencer who has gone from being simply the girlfriend of a player to a businesswoman learning to run her own P.R. firm. Although the role has already earned her two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, Temple admits that she still feels relatively new to the genre, which has ended up working in her favor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Comedic timing “was something that was definitely talked about in Season 1, and I would be like, ‘Uh, what? I don’t understand. I’m supposed to say my line and then hit my mark?’ And [Sudeikis] would be like, ‘No, no, no, you just do exactly what you’re doing,’” Temple tells BAZAAR.com from Calgary, where she’s shooting the new season of FX’s Fargo. “I think one of the ongoing jokes within the set is that sometimes Keeley is so funny ’cause I actually don’t fully understand the joke [myself].”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dressed in a Versace velvet cropped hoodie that evokes the bold and playful spirit of the character she plays on the show, Temple, in real life, feels much closer to Keeley than any of the women she’s played in the past. She likes printing her scripts and annotating them with fluffy ink pens, multi-color sticky tabs, and scented glitter highlighters. In conversation, she speaks at a swift pace and with a quiet self-possession that she’s honed from taking the life lessons that her own characters have learned to heart.</p><img alt="juno temple in los angeles on july 5, 2021" title="juno temple in los angeles on july 5, 2021" width=2700 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/junotemple-0077-640f8329272af.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Brian Guido</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress might not always share Keeley’s confidence in terms of her wardrobe, but she’s worked with costume designer Jacky Levy and hair and makeup designer Nicky Austin to incorporate some of her own pieces in the look of her character, who is constantly experimenting with different hairstyles and playing with glitter and piecey hair extensions. (Last season, because Temple is “obsessed” with mini handbags, Keeley had a handbag that could only fit a tiny lipstick.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Keeley “doesn’t really care what people think when she walks into a room with her wardrobe,” Temple explains. “It’s an expression of how she’s feeling, so to me, she’s like this rainbow. … And that also allows for the kind of theme that Ted Lasso is always reminding us of, which is, ‘Don’t judge a book by its cover.’ She might walk into a room and somebody really might think she’s one thing, and they will be surprised when they get to know her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The same could be said of Temple. Brett Goldstein—who plays Keeley’s love interest, Roy Kent—was initially nervous about working with Temple, but building the relationship between their characters, “who are learning through each other and daring to be better,” has become one of the most “special” parts of his job. “As soon as we met, she said that if we trust each other and have each other’s back we can always be safe with each other and do anything,” he tells BAZAAR in an email. “She is an incredible scene partner. She is pure light. You have to try to reflect light back at her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While Keeley comes in regular contact with the players and coaching staff of the fictional club AFC Richmond, her relationships with Roy and whip-smart owner Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham) have emerged as beloved cornerstones of the show. Despite never having played another character across multiple seasons, Temple believes the key to the long-term success of both relationships stems from her offscreen connections with Waddingham and Goldstein, who have become two of her closest friends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Temple and Waddingham first met in a ladies’ loo just minutes before the inaugural Ted Lasso table read in London in 2019, and they were both struck by the immediacy of their connection. As two of the only female characters on a show about a male sports team, the actresses initially expected for their characters to be pitted against each other—a byproduct of seeing past depictions of relationships between women, especially of different generations. But instead, Keeley and Rebecca have become these “extraordinary mirrors for one another,” Temple says, “who are allowed to just adore each other and also call each other out on things” instead of trying to outsmart or compete with each other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For instance, in the Season 3 premiere, Keeley admits to Rebecca behind closed doors that she’s overwhelmed with the demands of running her own company, including having to learn how to conduct herself in a professional office setting and what the term “CFO” stands for, and Rebecca offers a shoulder to cry on during a “momentary meltdown” about work and her relationship with Roy. “I love that they meet in the middle with the things that they’re teaching each other,” Temple adds. “Rebecca really helps Keeley see that she is smarter than she gives herself credit for; Keeley helps Rebecca see that she’s so much fun, that she’s gorgeous, and that she needs to embrace the creature that she is that isn’t a boss and a divorcée. She’s somebody so much more powerful than that, and she’s got so much to give [to someone like] Keeley. Getting to develop this friendship on camera has been one of the greatest joys of my career.”</p><img alt="ted lasso season 3 juno temple" title="ted lasso season 3 juno temple" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ted-lasso-photo-030106-640f83c917888.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Colin Hutton</span><p>Juno Temple and Hannah Waddingham as Keely and Rebecca in Ted Lasso season 3.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After splitting with top player Jamie Tartt (Phil Dunster) early in the first season, Keeley begins dating Roy—the fan-favorite, foul-mouthed former player-turned-coach—in the sophomore season, in which they explore the realities of being a serious couple. It’s a romantic relationship that Temple has lovingly described as “the Beauty and the Beast” and that she and Goldstein have worked closely to craft, essentially creating a shorthand that comes alive on the screen. “We talked about little things that people wouldn’t see, like what they would have for dinner, and what Keeley’s favorite movies would be,” Temple recalls with a laugh. “He actually likes kids’ cartoons, and she likes horror films. Just tidbits for us that would be funny, where they kind of clash but also [show] what they adore about each other.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The writers, including Goldstein, have spoken about their desire to create a healthy, loving relationship that doesn’t just go up in flames for dramatic effect, but there were little hints throughout the second season that there might be trouble in paradise for Keeley and Roy. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isBy6m4Qyf4&ab_channel=Kinobook" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="In the penultimate episode" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>In the penultimate episode</u></a>, Roy confesses that he chatted with his niece’s teacher for three hours and neglected to tell her that he was in a relationship; Keeley confesses that Nate (Nick Mohammed) impulsively kissed her and Jamie said he was still in love with her. By the end of the season, Keeley <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWZYvunnKm4&ab_channel=Kinobook" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="declines a trip" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>declines a trip</u></a> with Roy in order to get her public relations company off the ground.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The third season picks up at the start of the next Premier League season, with Keeley attempting to build her brand while processing the unspoken state of her personal life. “Blindsided, I think, sounds harsher than the reality of what happens, but I think it’s a misunderstanding,” Temple says of what leads to the next development in Keeley and Roy’s relationship. “Life gets busy, and things come in your way that stop something else from happening, like, for example, taking a six-week holiday when you’ve just started your own business. That’s not saying, ‘I don’t want to go there with you.’ It’s saying, ‘I have to stay here and do this right now.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, viewers might wonder, what does that mean for Keeley’s relationship with Jamie? Temple is intentionally vague, but she says she has used Bill Durham—the 1988 baseball rom-com, starring Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, that Sudeikis told her to watch during the filming of the first season—as a point of reference for Keeley, Roy and Jamie’s dynamic. “I think that says quite a lot there,” Temple says with a smile. “I think Keeley has always believed that Jamie could be one of the greatest footballers of all time and that he would just have to understand and [move past] some of his personal traumas … and I think she also sees the potential of how good Jamie and Roy could be in each other’s lives.”</p><img alt='los angeles fyc special screening of apple tv&#39;s "ted lasso" arrivals' title='Los Angeles FYC Special Screening of Apple TV+&#39;s "Ted Lasso" - Arrivals' width=780 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/juno-temple-and-brett-goldstein-attend-the-los-angeles-fyc-news-photo-1678738595.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gregg DeGuire</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Temple and her Ted Lasso co-star Brett Goldstein.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Earlier this month, Sudeikis confirmed that the new, 12-episode season of Ted Lasso is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2023/03/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-season-3-spoilers-series-finale-spinoffs-1235280998/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the end of the story that he and his co-creators wanted to tell" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>the end of the story that he and his co-creators wanted to tell</u></a>, but he would not rule out a spinoff or a continuation in some capacity. Temple, for her part, did not approach the third season like it would be the show’s last, instead choosing to stay in the moment of each scene. “I don’t think we ever thought of playing anything like it was an ending, because even if it was to be the last season, it’s not like the apocalypse happens,” she says. “[These characters] would keep going and living their lives and doing their extraordinary things and being an amazing team.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“With the timing of everything and the world kind of stopping the way it did for such a long time, we kind of didn’t realize the impact of Ted until, I would say, the past year or past six months,” Temple says of the reaction to the show potentially coming to an end. “Honestly, I just want to keep making the fans happy. If they love the show, I hope they like this season as much as we loved making it. That’s what matters to me the most.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I just want to keep making the fans happy. That’s what matters to me the most.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Temple, Ted Lasso has been a transformational experience—as well as an education in comedy, bravery, sisterhood and womanhood—and has “opened doors to some extraordinary parts” that have presented her with new creative challenges. After starring in The Offer, the Paramount+ miniseries about the making of The Godfather, Temple will play a lead role opposite Jon Hamm in the new season of Fargo. (“I can tell you nothing [about Fargo] other than it’s very cold [in Calgary], which makes the Minnesota accent make a lot of sense, because you don’t move your mouth much,” she says with a laugh.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Looking back, Temple recognizes that the dramatic roles she played earlier in her career have led her to this moment, when she finds herself in the running for meaty roles that are equal parts “terrifying” and “deeply exciting.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I feel like I’ve definitely hit puberty on camera now,” she says with a laugh, referring to the teenagers she played well into her 20s. “These more recent roles that have come into my life came from having played a lot of young girls that are figuring things out—sometimes they were having a good time, sometimes they were having a really hard time—and I think each one of them has been a challenge and an honor. I think when it comes to playing parts and choosing parts, I want to try it all. I really do.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Max Gao is a freelance entertainment and sports journalist based in Toronto.
