The only thing about his family so far is the name of his mother, Lisa Hall. Beyond this, knowledge about his father and his siblings, if he is not the only child of his parents, has remained a mystery. That said, Bryce’s fans knew that the social media star didn’t have the nicest relationship with his dad.</p><p>Instagram a picture of himself with his mother at the end of June 2017, Bryce wrote: “Happy Father’s Day Dad, thank you for being an abusive piece of s—and to my mum, here’s my favorite photo of me and him #SingleMomsRule” In a 2020 essay published in PEOPLE Magazine, Bryce doubled in distaste for his anonymous father. He said:</p><p>“[My father] was never present, and […] I knew [that] he was violent and reckless. He spent time behind bars on unpaid child support and neglect…”In stark contrast, Bryce found his mother to be a saint. In the language of his own: “As a single mom, she worked very hard to raise me, and she’s always been my number one supporter of everything—including my screw-ups. I knew that if I had listened to her 100%, I wouldn’t have ended up [in jail for one night].”For his part, Lisa keeps sharing pictures of Bryce on her IG.</p><h2><span id=Height_weight_other_physical_characteristics>Height, weight, other physical characteristics</span></h2><p>Bryce Hall stands at <strong>5 feet and 11 inches in height (1.80 meters).</strong> Also, at that time, his weight was confirmed to be<strong> 68 kg (150 lbs).</strong> His dimpled grin, his stylishly shimmering dark brown locks, his eyes of the same hue, and his tattooed forearm are some of his distinctive physical features that only add to his beauty.</p><h2><span id=Reach_TikTok_IG_Youtube_Twitter>Reach: TikTok, IG, Youtube, Twitter</span></h2><p>By the end of May 2020, Bryce Hall had enjoyed about 1.68 million subscribers on its own YouTube site. Meanwhile, on his TikTok account of the same name, he had 7.2 million followers, with more than 318.2 million likes in his videos. Bryce already had an impressive 3.9 m followers on his Instagram and 769K on his Twitter account, which he joined back in May 2014. In his mid-teens, Bryce had become involved in social media. In the beginning, he managed to have thousands of followers on the “Vine” 6-second video app, which was no longer working. The mechanism went off-line in January 2017. He proceeded, however, to create his content on Musical (now TikTok).</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_Sway_House_Endorsements>Net Worth, Sway House, Endorsements</span></h2><p>By 2020, Bryce Hall’s <strong>net worth was valued at $650 thousand</strong> by some source. From what it looked like, its source of revenue ranged from Youtube ads to several other endorsements. He also sold merchandise, including his recently released ‘Party Animal’ collection. Moving on, Bryce is also one of the founders of the Sway House Collective, a social group founded at the end of 2019 by TalentX Entertainment with Nick Bean as the group’s creative director. The collaboration consists of seven young artists and social media influencers—besides Bryce, Josh Richards, Anthony Reeves, Jaden Hossler, Griffin Johnson, Kio Cyr, and Nick Bean.</p><table style=height:100%;width:100% data-tablestyle=MsoTableGrid data-tablelook=1696><tbody><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Estimated Net Worth in 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0>$650 thousand</td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Previous Year’s Net Worth (2020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0>$640 thousand</td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Annual Salary&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>&nbsp;UNDER REVIEW&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Income Source&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>Social media influencer</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Bryce_Hall_Girlfriend_History_of_Dating><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span>Bryce Hall Girlfriend, History of Dating</span></h2><p>Bryce Hall briefly dated to Elle Danjean, a young professional dancer, back in 2019. Although this article was written at the time, and sometime before that, Bryce was rumored to be dating famous content maker, Addison Rae, who had more than 18 million followers on her TikTok as of March 2020. The two were frequently seen in each other’s contents. And it was mostly the trigger that led their fans to believe that Bryce and Addison were an item even in real life before Addison interviewed Entertainment Tonight in February 2020.</p><p>Bryce Hall with a rumored-girlfriend, Addison Rae at Bel Air, Los Angeles on January 18, 2020 (Pic: Bryce’s IG)At last, the stunning TikTok sensation admitted that it was all untrue and that they were “just friends.” She explained how they quickly got “super tight” once they started to hang out.</p><h2><span id=This_is_exactly_how_Addison_put_it_In_its_exact_words>This is exactly how Addison put it.

Things have happened, and we have agreed that we’re better off as partners…</p><p>But right now, I think we’re better off as friends, and that’s what we all agreed. We love each other so much, and we love to be around each other, and we’re super good friends, for now, it’s best to stay that way.”In a June 2020 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Bryce stirred up controversy when he opened up his friendship with Addison. He disclosed:</p><p>“We’re going to hang out. We’re really, like, very good friends. Like, we’ve never broken… we’ve never been split for very bad reasons, you know? We were just busy doing our own things. Now with quarantine, not that busy. I don’t say anything, but we’re friends. We’re very good mates of mine.”He and Addison were bound by their rise to fame, admittedly. When asked about his favorite thing about Addison, Bryce said she was smiling. Bryce then joked that the fans had to be optimistic about the prospect of dating him and Addison.</p><h2><span id=Is_Bryce_Hall_Gay_or_Bisexual_huh>Is Bryce Hall Gay or Bisexual, huh?</span></h2><p>Bryce Hall has neither verified nor refuted the reports about his sexuality. The gay may have been there in the first place because of his flirty relationship with his colleagues. To power up, Bryce posted his Instagram, a slideshow of his New Year’s kisses, and all but one was with his Sway House boys. Bryce Hall Arrested, Prison, Charges</p><p>Police arrested Bryce Hall and Jaden Hossler on 25 May 2020 on drug-related charges in Giddings, Texas. A day later, Lee County Sheriff’s office announced that the Sway House couple was in prison. According to sources, Bryce was charged with possession of fewer than two ounces of marijuana. If found guilty, he will spend 180 days in prison or pay a $2,000 penalty. The Sheriff’s office also set Bryce’s bond at $5 thousand.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>social media influencer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Emiru Bio, Age, Net Worth, Profession</a></h3>Emiru is an American social media influencer, Tiktok celebrity, and Twitch streamer.
