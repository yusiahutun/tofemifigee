data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the mall</a> — may she rest in peace — was the place to be on a Friday night. Armed with the $10 we begged our mothers for on our way out the door, we set off for Bath & Body Works in packs of three to five, a truly terrifying posse of hormones on legs. Later we'd hit Victoria's Secret, where we hung out in the beauty section and sprayed each other obnoxiously with Love Spell while nervously eyeing the lacy lingerie and dreaming of a day when we might have a reason to buy some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, I developed quite the collection of Bath & Body Works lotions, body sprays, and cheap perfumes. But the crown jewel of my collection was the bottle of Marc Jacobs Daisy that I had saved up to buy my junior year of high school. I displayed ite on my shelf proudly for my friends to see when they came over, and they did the same with their bottles of Vera Wang Princess, Clinique Happy, and Ed Hardy fragrances.</p><p>There was something about Daisy that felt more "official" than a simple body spray — perhaps it was the glass bottle or the gold hardware or the designer name. Wearing Daisy felt like stepping out of the shower in late spring after a long day of school work and soccer practice, something I'd put on before a beach bonfire with my crush. In a way, it represented an idealized version of who I wanted to be, someone who wears "light" perfume, but doesn't think twice about it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I'm pretty sure my bottle of Daisy is sitting somewhere at my dad's house, I'm now looking for something more intense, spicier. Maybe it's still floral, but not quite so universally appealing; something an Ingrid Bergman character might wear. A scent that announces itself, and was thought about.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To find my new go-to, I spoke to Mindy Yang, founder and CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Perfumarie</a>, a retail lab and brand incubator in New York. But first, she broke down a bit of the history of the perfume industry, how women's relationships with scents have evolved over different generations, and what trippy fragrances the future holds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-makes-a-teen-scent></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What makes a teen scent?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yang says youthful scents tend to be lighter and fresher than the heavy or spicy fragrances of our grandmothers' era. "The notes tend to be more of your brighter white-florals-meets-fruit profiles, more gourmandy," says Yang.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We always have the orange flowers as very popular notes," she continues. "Your nerolis and grapefruits and citrus on top are really popular. And then you also have sporty profiles, aquatic profiles. Basically, the vibes are happy and fresh and invigorating." And it's not just a certain type of scent that appeals to younger women. "You see a little bit of a ritual in the experience of wearing it," she adds, "like, 'I'm wearing a perfume. I'm grown-up.'"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-boomers-vs-gen-x-vs-millennials-vs-gen-z></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Boomers vs. Gen X vs. Millennials vs. Gen Z</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Boomers, Yang explains, tended to look at their perfumes as their signature. Purchasing perfume was an event, and women wanted "really big, heavy perfumes, like your Opium and your Chanel No. 5s, and fragrances that have big designer houses behind them and usually a very high-impact signature." Or else they opted for scents they picked up at the beauty counter, a treat while grabbing the essentials at Macy's.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gen X, on the other hand, came of age in the era of celebrity perfumes. "You have a Revlon, L'Oreal, all these brands, and they're basically all about the celebrity," says Yang.Popular celeb fragrances included Elizabeth Taylor's Pearls, the Spice Girls' Impulse, and Naomi Campbell's eponymous perfume. In this era, she explains, "fragrances smelled really similar, and they are mostly synthetic, and mostly fresh and inexpensive and brights scents."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the time millennials arrived on the scene, we were seeking fresh fragrances and steering clear of celebrity lines (save for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Britney Spears</a> and Paris Hilton, both prolific perfumers who are in a league of their own). This is also the era when a scent was treated less like a signature and more like a lipstick — something that sets the tone for your day, says Yang.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that we've mostly aged out of the celebrity-crush stage of shopping, millennials and Gen Z are all about "artistic" scents and fragrance education, which includes an emphasis on sustainability and gaining a true understanding of where and how ingredients are sourced. Rather than buying a scent to fit in, this cohort is concerned with finding a fragrance that draws, "What's that? I've never seen it before." The urge to have what no one else has can be appealing at any age — as is the rush of finding the exact scent to match a specific vibe or mood — and Yang says artistic fragrances are growing in popularity for that exact reason.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's a huge collector base for something that is truly more like fragrance as art, which I love, because why isn't fragrance art?" she notes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shopping-tips-for-every-generation></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shopping tips for every generation:</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So how do you find the adult scent that matches the essence of what you loved in your youth? First, see if we've found its match for you below. If not, Yang has a clever hack: "If [your perfume] is by a well-known brand, there's always a perfumer behind it," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She likened the way a perfumer moves between brands to the way a fashion designer might migrate between luxury houses. When Raf Simons was at Dior, for example, his creations were very different than the pieces he designed for Calvin Klein. Though, for the most part, you could still feel Raf's hand in every collection. The same rule of tracing applies to the fragrance industry. Follow a perfumer's career, and you may just find they created scents that matured alongside your fragrance predilections.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Yang hand-picked some present-day matches based on popular youthful choices you might love, too. Here, 10 scents for your perfume glow-up, based on what you wore as a teen:</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Vera Wang Princess: Teisenddu</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Princess's warm vanilla spice notes are elevated in Teisenddu, which captures that same sweet warmth with "a delicious heart of dried fruit and nuts macerated in rum and enveloped by honeyed mimosa, while an intriguing blend of leather and dark sugar crystals complete the recipe," according to the website.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Marc Jacobs Daisy: Eau Papaguena</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Marc's youthful, sunny floral scent is elevated with a burst of sunshine from the wild jungle of Bali," says Yang.

"A rare perfume for a new generation, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Éclat de Joie</a> sports citrus, fresh-floral opening, but instead of mimosa, it confidently stars the iris — one of the most expensive raw materials in the world.

Beyond how they'll look in your shelfie, though, both share rose and mandarin notes.
