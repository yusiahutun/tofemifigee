It is usually put on the second Sunday of May since many people are more available during the weekend than weekdays. This years mothers day in Kenya is set to be on the 12th of May, 2019 which has already people buzzing about it, already giving them a nostalgic feeling as per what happened last year. I would definitely say that mother’s day brings people together and brings an awesomeness to mothers even when they tend to think they don’t deserve to be awesome. The first mother’s day took place in the early 20th century, in 1908 by Anna Jarvis who was determined to honor her mother even in death.

A mother is always deserving of a good husband since she displays responsibility and a bit of leadership skills which makes her stand outd. For instance, in Kenya, it is such a blessing to have a wife who is skilled in her motherly and wifely duties and knows how to look good and manage other duties in the house. In this case, a man is simply obliged to consider himself lucky since the wife is viewed as a gem. This is one of the best happy mother’s day messages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs6bl3abkf504.jpg><p class=align-left>The husband counts his wife as a blessing and as a beauty who makes him marvel each and every day of his life. He acknowledges her as a good mother since she probably raises the children in a way that truly impresses him and seems to be acceptable in society and is morally acceptable.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Respect Quotes for Parents</p><p class=align-left>A husband always considers his wife as a friend since she offers a loyalty that is irreplaceable and indisputable. It is out of the ordinary to have both a mother and a wife in one woman who still holds it down for the whole family when things don’t seem to be going smoothly. Husbands ought to respect and be grateful for their wives, otherwise, whom else can carry out household activities and manage the pressure better than their own wives? I bet even the man himself would succumb to the pressure! To all women, happy mother’s day.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Blmxncmxdl7K0wIyhmKmoqWK6sMDHnqmsZZSWxm691KirnqtdncK0rsCnm2avmZuyb7TTpqM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-temporarily-disable-your-lutron-caseta-light-switches.html>&#171;&nbsp;How to Temporarily Disable Your Lutron Caseta Light Switches</a>
