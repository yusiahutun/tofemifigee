experience when it comes to reality TV will tell you, it seems as if there is a reality TV show covering every possible genre.</p><p>We’ve seen shows like Big Brother, Jersey Shore, Ex on the Beach, and so on.</p><p>Lately, however, we’ve seen a sharp rise in the amount of reality TV shows featuring animals.</p><p>Beforehand, it was channels like MTV and VH1 that were synonymous with reality TV, but nowadays, we have Discovery, National Geographic, Animal Planet, and History all getting in on the act and offering educational and informative reality TV that actually helps.</p><p>While there are all kinds of reality TV shows featuring animals, there is one that resonates strongly with animal lovers, and dog lovers in particular, and that show is Pit Bulls and Parolees.</p><p>While the title may make it sound a little cheesy, this is not your average reality TV show, and it is, in fact, surprisingly moving.</p><p>One of the show’s main characters, Mariah Torres, has been in the headlines recently as rumors began circulating talking about health issues. But does Mariah Torres have cancer?</p><h3><strong>Who is Mariah Torres?</strong></h3><p>Mariah Torres is the daughter of Tia Maria Torres and is one of four siblings (including Koe and <a href=#>Kanani Chock</a>, whom her mom adopted, and her sister <a href=#>Tania</a>).</p><p><a href=#>Tia</a> is the founder of the Villalobos Rescue Center, which is a rescue center for dogs, though it primarily focuses on pit bulls.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77027 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tia-Torres.jpg.webp alt="Tia Torres" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tia-Torres.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77027 class=wp-caption-text>Tia Torres – @Getty</p><p>The rescue center is the subject of the hit Animal Planet reality TV show Pit Bulls and Parolees.</p><p>Mariah Torres was one of the show’s main stars, along with her mom Tia Maria Torres and sister, Tania.</p><p>Because of her no-BS attitude and kind heart, Mariah was a very popular cast member on the show. Recent pics of her, however, have resulted in people wondering if she is unwell.</p><p>Don’t worry; we’ll address the ‘does Mariah Torres have cancer?’ rumors a little later on. First, though, let’s look at Pit Bulls and Parolees.</p><h3><strong>What is Pit Bulls and Parolees?</strong></h3><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-77029 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/does-mariah-from-pitbulls-and-parolees-have-cancer.jpg.webp alt="does mariah from pitbulls and parolees have cancer" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/does-mariah-from-pitbulls-and-parolees-have-cancer.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-77029 class=wp-caption-text>Kanani Torres, Mariah Torres and Kelii Torres attend Woofstock: Road To Puppy Bowl at Soldier Field – @Getty</p><p>Pit Bulls and Parolees was one of the most popular shows on Animal Planet, which fell under the Discovery banner. It ran for 19 seasons and had a global following.</p><p>The show centered on the Villalobos Rescue Center in Louisiana.</p><p>The rescue center is for dogs, mainly “dangerous breeds” or “bully breeds” as they are known, such as pit bull terriers.</p><p>The basic premise for the show is that the VRC takes in so-called dangerous dog breeds, trains them, shelters them, gives them food, and helps to find them new and loving forever homes.</p><p>The ‘Parolees’ part comes due to the fact that the rescue center provides employment for recently released prison parolees who are looking to integrate back into society and earn a living after spending time in prison for various crimes.</p><p>It features founder Tia Maria Torres, her two daughters Mariah and Tania, and her two adopted sons Moe and Kanani, along with their wives Mariah (known as M2 to avoid confusion) and Lizzie.</p><p>The show first began in 2009 and ran for 19 seasons until it was sadly canceled in 2022.</p><p>During its time on air, however, it proved to be a huge success and did a lot for animal welfare.</p><p>As it is a reality TV show, it also features an insight into the characters of the show and their personal lives.</p><p>Each episode featured several stories but generally followed the same formula of a dog being rescued and then adopted.</p><p>The parolees working at the center would also be featured throughout the episodes.</p><h3><strong>Pit Bulls and Parolees Background Info</strong></h3><p><br>The VRC was formed by Tia Torres in California before relocating to New Orleans in 2011.</p><p>Tia initially had plans to move the center from New Orleans to a small town in California.</p><p>Her chosen venue, Tehachapi, looked perfect as Kern County, CA, had an abundance of pit bulls, and there was a prison facility nearby, which would provide employment for the parolees.</p><p>After securing the necessary paperwork and permits, her chosen venue, Kern County, pulled out of the deal and did not grant permission for the rescue center to conduct their business.</p><p>Tia lost a considerable amount of money, along with time and effort. They were forced to remain in California for a year.</p><p>Following the touching memories of the VRC during Hurricane Katrina, Tia decided that Louisiana should be the home of the rescue center.</p><p>Because of the weather there, the VRC is frequently affected by storms and hurricanes, which only adds to their troubles.</p><p>In 2022, after 19 seasons, the show ended due to budget cuts at Warner Bros.</p><p>Despite this, the show remains very popular, as do the characters such as Mariah.</p><h2><strong>Does Mariah Torres have cancer?</strong></h2><p>Mariah was one of the show’s most popular characters, and her relationship with then-husband Marcel proved to be a focal point of the show. The couple divorced after a few months as the two were not compatible and wanted different things.</p><p>Her social media posts in 2019 indicated she was single and dating again, though in 2020 she claimed to be single again. Rumors also began surrounding her sexuality as people believed she was lesbian or bisexual. Mariah, however, has addressed these issues and says she doesn’t put labels on herself.</p><p>In 2022, images emerged of Mariah looking very thin and frail. This resulted in people speculating that she was sick. Some claimed that she may have been sick due to cancer or cancer treatment, though there is no evidence to back this up.</p><p>So, does Mariah Torres have cancer? Well, not as far as we are aware. There is no indication that Mariah has cancer, or any other illness for that matter. Her weight loss may have been intentional, though the only person who knows for sure is Mariah.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Who is the father of Tia Torres’ daughters</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Is Mariah Torres still married</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Who is Keanu Reeves’ biological father</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Does Jschlatt actually own GamerSupps</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Lewie Wayne Earhardt: Who’s Ainsley Earhardt’s Father</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfmbymv4ymmKuhkZ16tbvRq5ysZZiWw6Z5wpqlnJ2iZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./living-proof-no-frizz-instant-de-frizzer-review.html>&#171;&nbsp;Living Proof No Frizz Instant De-Frizzer Review: My Flyaways Are Gone</a>
