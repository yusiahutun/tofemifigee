charges before her trial</p><p><span>A jury in Jefferson County has convicted a 29-year-old mother of murder after leaving her two-year-old son to die in a sweltering car while she was unconscious through drug abuse in her apartment.</span></p><p><span>Despite frequent interruptions in the six-day trial, where Mollie Shouse was too overcome with emotion for proceedings to continue, the jury took only a few hours to return a guilty verdict - recommending a 35-year sentence.</span></p><p><span>It is believed to be the first murder conviction for a death of this kind.</span></p><p><span>Six men and six women found Shouse guilty of the death of Kenton Brown. She was found guilty on further charges of wanton endangerment, criminal abuse and possession of a controlled substance.<br></span></p><p><span>Shouse will be formally sentenced in September. While she could have been given a life sentence, the 35 years recommended by the jury means that - if so sentenced - she will be eligible for parole when she is 49 years old.</span></p><p><span>Prosecutor Erin McKenzie told reporters after the case: 'Nothing will bring that baby back, but this is as close as we can get to justice for him.'</span></p><p><span>The verdict is not a full murder conviction, rather that of 'wanton murder' - which means that Shouse didn’t intentionally kill her son but acted with 'wanton and extreme indifference' to his wellbeing, resulting in his death.</span></p><p><span>Shouse's attorney Pattie Echsner said her client would appeal the decision.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/08/article-2185340-14709018000005DC-215_224x423.jpg height=423 width=224 alt="Shock: Shouse reacts during the six-day court case, which eventually saw a jury convict her of 'wanton murder'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/08/article-2185340-1470DFB7000005DC-541_224x423.jpg height=423 width=224 alt="Kenton Brown" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Shock: Shouse reacts to the jury's verdict, left, after they recommended she serve 35 years for allowing Kenton Brown, right, to die in the back of her car<br></p><p><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/08/article-0-1470443B000005DC-316_468x286.jpg height=286 width=468 alt="Crime scene: Shouse's car surrounded by police tape.
