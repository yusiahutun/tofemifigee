There have been many incredible hockey players in the past who are still remembered to date. There are also tons of great hockey players in the NHL today who will be recognized in the same realm.</p><p class=align-left>NFL features players from all over the <a href=#>world</a>, including the USA and European countries. However, Canada leads the charge in terms of NHL legends.</p><h2>Best Canadian hockey players of all time</h2><p class=align-left>A list of the best players in any sport will always be controversial. But that is the fun of it. According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pantheon World</a>, these are the best Canadian hockey players of all time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6ecf0309eb0b4a8a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best Swedish hockey players of all time in the National Hockey League</span></p></a><h3>1. Wayne Gretzky</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6ecf0309eb0b4a8a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Wayne Gretzky (born on 26th January 1961) is a former professional hockey player and head coach. He played 20 seasons in NHL (1979 – 1999) and featured for four teams; Edmonton Oilers, New York Rangers, St Louis Blues, and Los Angeles Kings.</p><p class=align-left>Wayne was nicknamed the "Great One" and has been called the greatest hockey player by ex-players, coaches, managers, and sportswriters.</p><p class=align-left>Why is Wayne Gretzky the greatest Canadian? To date, Gretzky is the only player to have recorded 200 points in a season – amazingly, he did it four times. He also holds a fantastic record for most goals in a season, with 92. Single-season records aside – Gretzky has a total of 894 career goals and 1963 assists which are just massive.</p><h3>2. Mario Lemieux</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/913caa0641993941.jpg><p class=align-left>Some fans argue that Mario is the best Canadian hockey player of all time. They believe that Lemieux's overall totals would be greater than Wayne Gretzky's if not for his back injuries and being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease while in his prime.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b66da92e3116e60a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are the best hockey players right now? The top 15 list</span></p></a><p class=align-left>All these issues limited him to only 915 games. But in those games, Mario managed 1883 points per game record which is second in league history. He also got 1723 points, ranking eighth, and 690 goals, ranking 11th. These are incredible stats for some who missed three seasons due to <a href=#>different injuries</a>.</p><h3>3. Bobby Orr</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6ad50736a9d89727.jpg><p class=align-left>In today's NHL, several defensemen have incredibly high points - thanks to Bobby Orr. Before Orr, the primary role of a defenseman was to keep the puck out of the net; they were not an offensive threat. But he changed this narrative by finishing his career with a record 100 points on different occasions.</p><p class=align-left>The stats prove Bobby's dominance in NHL. His 1,333 points per game is 15th all-time in league history. If not for his recurring knee injuries, Orr would undoubtedly be the highest all-time scoring defenseman. He managed to record 915 points and 270 goals in just 657 games.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/74c9653d0cf4fd22.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best hockey players of all time by position, ranked</span></p></a><h3>4. Gordie Howe</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b66da92e3116e60a.jpg><p class=align-left>Gordie isn’t the best but probably the most famous Canadian hockey player. Fans refer to him as Mr. Hockey because of his impact on the field. Before Wayne Gretzky and Bobby Orr, he was the best.</p><p class=align-left>It's not the stats that made Howe special but his longevity in <a href=#>the game</a>. He made 1,767 career appearances in NHL and 419 in WHA (World Hockey Association). The other Howe spectacular achievement that's remembered to date is the "Gordie Howe Hat Trick." A hat trick is accomplished when a player gets a fight, an assist, and, most importantly, a goal.</p><p class=align-left>When it comes to stats, Howe was also a beast. He got a total of 1,850 points which ranks fourth. He also has four NFL cups and six Art Rose and Harts Trophies on his sleeves.</p><h3>5. Mark Messier</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f7e0f91a34afbdf3.jpg><p class=align-left>In the 1980s, the Edmonton Oilers were invisible. Mark Messier featured for Edmonton Oilers in this era and played alongside the best hockey player of all time, Wayne Gretzky. Throughout his career, Mark won six Stanley Cups; five with the Oilers and one with New York Rangers. But these are just a few of the trophies he won.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dc01a589907abbae.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best young NHL players you need to check out in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Mark Messier made 1756 career appearances and got 1,887 career points, ranking third all-time, and 694 goals, ranking ninth. On top of all the incredible stats and trophies, he is regarded as one of the best leaders the NFL has ever had. That's why the annual trophy of the prestigious Mark Messier Leadership Award was introduced in the game in 2007.</p><h3>6. Steve Yzerman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/74c9653d0cf4fd22.jpg><p class=align-left>Steve played for Detroit Red Wings (1983 -2006) and is remembered for his extraordinary leadership. He was named the captain of Redwing in 1986 and made over 1,300 games with the armband. Under his captaincy, Detroit Red Wings won five President's Trophies and three Stanley Cups.</p><p class=align-left>He was also the super captain of the Canadian national Hockey team that won gold in the 1984 Canada Cup and the 2002 and 2005 Olympics. His stats were also attractive; he got 185 points in playoff games and 1,755 in 1,555 NHL appearances.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b0a62d310bd91cb0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best American hockey players of all time: Who is the greatest?</span></p></a><h3>7. Jean Arthur Beliveau</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d0b7e8e2e0c41480.jpg><p class=align-left>Like others on this list, Jean Beliveau is regarded as one of the best Canadian<a href=#> hockey players</a> because of his incredible stats. He had a prolific career with the famous Montreal Canadiens (1953 -1971).</p><p class=align-left>Jean was named the team captain in 1961 and scored 507 goals, which is impressive. He also won many cups/ trophies, including ten Stanley Cups, Hart Trophy, Conn Smythe Trophy, and more.</p><p class=align-left>After his professional career, Jean was appointed as the Canadiens' vice president. Later, in 1972 he got an induction into the coveted Hockey Hall of Fame – just one year after his retirement. Usually, players have to wait for three years to earn induction into the special Hockey Hall of Fame.</p><h3>8. Maurice Richard</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/95dd79bc02a5d5ea.jpg><p class=align-left>Maurice Richard was undoubtedly ahead of the game and is one of the best Canadian NHL players of all time.

Because of this record, his name is inscribed on the trophy awarded to NHL top scorers each season. Richard won eight championships in his 18 seasons and made 14 All-Star appearances.</p><h3>9. Bobby Hull</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dc01a589907abbae.jpeg><p class=align-left>Bobby Hull was a key player for NHL Chicago Black Hawks (1957 – 1972). He was one of the fastest players of his time, earning him the nickname "The Golden Jets." In the 1959 -1960 season, Bobby scored 39 goals. Two years later, he equaled Maurice Richard's record of 50 goals. In 1965 – 1966, he got better stats of 54 goals and 43 assists.</p><p class=align-left>Bobby's incredible performances helped his team, the Black Hawks, win the Stanley Cup. He also won other prestigious trophies, including the Hart Trophy, Lady Byng Trophy, and Ross Trophy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d9c133be42f2dcca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 hottest female chess players to watch out for in 2023</span></p></a><h3>10.
