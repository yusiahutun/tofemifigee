It was full of accusations and counter-accusations. Many factors led to their break up, the major one being infidelity on Steve's side.</p><p class=align-left>Wynton Harvey's mother accused Steve of being unfaithful and cheating on her with his current wife, Bridges. She also alleged that he was violent and would occasionally abuse her and their son. However, due to lack of evidence, all the charges were dropped.</p><h2>Mary Harvey's arrest and detention</h2><p class=align-left>Lee Vaughn went ahead to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">upload videos on YouTube</a> claiming that Steve abused her mentally and physically while they were married.
