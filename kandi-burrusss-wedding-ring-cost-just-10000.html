The stunning star has dazzled fans countless times with her lovely personality and character. However, before being famously known as one of the housewives, Burruss started in the entertainment industry very young.&nbsp;</p><p>While in high school, Burruss and four other girls, Tameka “Tiny” Cottle, sisters LaTocha Scott and Tamika Scott, and Tamera Coggins, <a href=#>formed</a> the music group called “ Xscape.” However, Tamera Coggins left the group shortly after.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/e7/4e/9e/e74e9e1e52d419ed761fa209a8f1e6ab.jpg><p>The group made its major debut in 1992 at BET’s Teen Summit. After the performance, they met record executive Ian Burke who later became their manager.</p><p>“Xscape” also impressed Jermaine Dupri, who signed them to his recording label So So Def Recordings. They released their debut album titled “Hummin’ Comin’ at ‘Cha” on October 12, 1993.</p><p>The album peaked at number seventeen on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and as high as number three on the Top R&B Albums chart. It was certified platinum within a year of its release.</p><p>In 1995 they released their second album, “Off the Hook,” which also went platinum. The album launched top singles like “Feels So Good” and “Who Can I Run To.” Their third and final album, “Traces of My Lipstick,” was also very successful.</p><p>It debuted at number 28 on the Billboard 200 and number six on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop album chart. After the album, LaTocha Scott left the group to focus on her solo career but returned to the group later.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Going_Solo></span><strong>Going Solo&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Due to many internal issues, “Xscape” disbanded, and afterward, Burruss focused on production and songwriting. In 1999 she and former bandmate Tameka “Tiny” Cottle wrote the hit song “No Scrubs” for TLC.&nbsp;</p><p>That same year, Burruss also wrote another hit song, “Bills, Bills, Bills,” for Destiny’s Child.

Their relationship blossomed, and on January 15, 2013, they revealed they were engaged.&nbsp;Burruss and Tucker got married on April 4, 2014, in a “Coming To America” themed marriage ceremony.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kandi_Burruss_Wedding_Ring_Was_Over-hyped></span><strong>Kandi Burruss’ Wedding Ring Was Over-hyped</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Burruss <a href=#>announced</a> her engagement to Tucker, the news exited a lot of fans. One of the main takeaways was the ring Tucker proposed which was described as a “gorgeous two-carat white diamond sparkler” by ring designer Gregg Ruth.&nbsp;</p><p>Burruss had told Tucker about the ring before he had it shipped to Atlanta from Las Vegas. With the two-carat oval diamond, the ring reportedly cost over $40,000.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/4e/cd/38/4ecd38a740cde5cdc86d5063c1c7ed46.jpg><p>However, after looking at the ring and Gregg Ruth’s website, the ring is <a href=#>listed</a> for about $11,000. A deeper look into the video description revealed the ring is not a “two-carat diamond sparkler.”&nbsp;Instead, the face of the ring, which is oval in shape, actually contained smaller round diamonds which made the entire diamond look larger than it was.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kandi_Burruss_Wedding_Dress_Was_Very_Expensive></span><strong>Kandi Burruss’ Wedding Dress Was Very Expensive</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Burruss stunned guests at her wedding when she <a href=#>emerged</a> wearing a gorgeous wedding dress.
