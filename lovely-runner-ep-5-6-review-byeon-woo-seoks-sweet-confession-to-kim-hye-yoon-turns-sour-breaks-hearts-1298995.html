Later, Sol listens to music and finally hears the full recording of Sun Jae confessing his feelings for her, and simultaneously, Sun Jae asks her to break up for his sake.

Kim Hye Yoon and Byeon Woo Seok are just perfect together, and their chemistry is through the roof. Every time they're on screen together, you can't help but fall in love with them and get butterflies in your stomach. Whether it's their sweet movie date, Sun Jae's adorable blushing, or Im Sol's heart racing, every moment they share is pure magic. And let's not forget the hilarious scenes, like when they're trying to hide from Im Sol's brother or cheering on their favorite baseball team.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Im Sol's determination to show Sun Jae the beauty of life is so heartwarming. From rainbows to simple joys, she's always eager to share everything with him. And it's no surprise that Sun Jae's heart melts whenever Im Sol does something cute or unexpected, like saving him from an oncoming bike.</p><br><p>Even early into the series, we get confessions and kisses, making this rom-com feel like Christmas morning! But the second lead syndrome hits us hard as we watch Tae Sung fall for Im Sol. And just when we thought things couldn't get more intense, we're hit with a darker storyline behind Im Sol's accident.&nbsp;</p><p>Episode 6 takes a thrilling turn as Sol finds herself in a dangerous situation with the menacing taxi driver responsible for her tragic accident. Suddenly, the show is giving off major crime thriller vibes. Will Sol remember the truth in time to save herself? And how much time does she have left to make everything right? The twists in the show are as heartbreaking, interesting, and intense as the sweet romance balancing everything out.</p><p>Let's not forget about Hyun Woo and Im Geum's budding romance. It seems like Sung Jae's charming face won't be enough to stop the desires of Im Geum's heart. She's falling hard for Im Sol's brother, which makes us wonder why they weren't together in the future. But for now, they're blossoming plotlines that are just too adorable together.</p><br><h2 id=663272ed3f2b5><strong>Lovely Runner: The negatives</strong></h2><p>The anticipation for the upcoming episodes is the only downside of the show. Waiting a whole week to see what happens next feels like torture, especially when each episode ends on a cliffhanger. The preview for episode 7 hinting at some kind of amnesia has us both intrigued and worried. Will the show take a cliche route or incorporate multiple elements without becoming too complex? Hopefully, it stays true to its charm and keeps us hooked without veering into messy territory. Only time will tell, and we'll have to wait patiently to find out.</p><br><h2 id=663272ed3f2b9><strong>Lovely Runner: Acting performance</strong></h2><p>Byeon Woo Seok is currently the hottest heartthrob in town, all thanks to his portrayal of Sun Jae. The way he effortlessly switches between a tough persona in front of Sol and later blushes at her every action has fans swooning like crazy. Starring in Lovely Runner, it seems like he's found the role that will define his career. Netizens believe he's perfectly suited for the romantic comedy lead, and they're clamoring for him to debut as an idol member. It's like this character was tailor-made for him!</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Byeon Woo Seok's portrayal of Sun Jae's love for Im Sol, his raw vulnerabilities, and his genuine feelings hit all the right notes, making him the ideal boyfriend everyone dreams of. He's truly stolen the hearts of fans everywhere!</p><p>Kim Hye Yoon shines brilliantly as Im Sol, portraying her as the epitome of reliability. She's like a ray of sunshine, and anyone who watches her can't help but agree. The way she cares for Sun Jae, her moments of awkwardness, shyness, and relatable fangirling—all of it radiates through Kim Hye Yoon's acting. Her unwavering support for Sun Jae is truly touching, and thanks to Kim Hye Yoon's performance, it's visible on screen.</p><p>And let's talk about that smile! It's like a magnet instantly drawing Sun Jae and viewers in. Kim Hye Yoon's infectiously bright smile makes us all root for Im Sol, wishing for her success in bringing positivity into Sun Jae's life. Despite her small build, she exudes strength, and we can't help but admire her resilience. Here's to hoping she continues to be a beacon of light for Sun Jae and everyone around her!</p><p>Song Geon Hee, who portrays Kim Tae Sung, is also winning over viewers as his character begins to develop feelings for Im Sol. He exudes vibes reminiscent of Han Seo Jun (Hwang In Yeop) from True Beauty, effortlessly captivating fans' hearts. His bromance with Byeon Woo Seok's character adds another layer of adorableness to the show, and his growing affection for Im Sol is both sweet and heartbreaking, considering his position as the second lead.</p><br><br><br><h2 id=663272ed3f2be><strong>Lovely Runner Overall Review</strong></h2><p>These last two episodes were absolutely adorable! Lovely Runner has a knack for kicking off each episode with heart-fluttering romantic moments, only to leave us hanging with intense cliffhangers by the end. The chemistry between the duo is just too cute to resist, and whoever isn't tuning in is seriously missing out. Can't wait for the next episodes to see what unfolds!</p><p><strong>Stay updated with the latest Hallyu news on:</strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Lovely Runner Ep 5-6 Review: Byeon Woo Seok&#39;s sweet confession to Kim Hye Yoon turns sour; breaks hearts","1298995","https://bit.ly/hallyutalk_ig","articlepage","/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-5-6-review-byeon-woo-seoks-sweet-confession-to-kim-hye-yoon-turns-sour-breaks-hearts-1298995"," Instagram","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'><strong> </strong><strong><u>Instagram</u></strong></a><strong>,</strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Lovely Runner Ep 5-6 Review: Byeon Woo Seok&#39;s sweet confession to Kim Hye Yoon turns sour; breaks hearts","1298995","https://bit.ly/hallyutalk_yt","articlepage","/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-5-6-review-byeon-woo-seoks-sweet-confession-to-kim-hye-yoon-turns-sour-breaks-hearts-1298995"," YouTube","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'><strong> </strong><strong><u>YouTube</u></strong></a><strong>,</strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Lovely Runner Ep 5-6 Review: Byeon Woo Seok&#39;s sweet confession to Kim Hye Yoon turns sour; breaks hearts","1298995","https://bit.ly/hallyutalk_twt","articlepage","/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-5-6-review-byeon-woo-seoks-sweet-confession-to-kim-hye-yoon-turns-sour-breaks-hearts-1298995"," Twitter","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'><strong> </strong><strong><u>Twitter</u></strong></a><strong>,</strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Lovely Runner Ep 5-6 Review: Byeon Woo Seok&#39;s sweet confession to Kim Hye Yoon turns sour; breaks hearts","1298995","https://bit.ly/hallyutalk_fb","articlepage","/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-5-6-review-byeon-woo-seoks-sweet-confession-to-kim-hye-yoon-turns-sour-breaks-hearts-1298995"," Facebook","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'><strong> </strong><strong><u>Facebook</u></strong></a><strong> and</strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Lovely Runner Ep 5-6 Review: Byeon Woo Seok&#39;s sweet confession to Kim Hye Yoon turns sour; breaks hearts","1298995","https://bit.ly/hallyutalk_sc","articlepage","/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-5-6-review-byeon-woo-seoks-sweet-confession-to-kim-hye-yoon-turns-sour-breaks-hearts-1298995"," Snapchat","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'><strong> </strong><strong><u>Snapchat</u></strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Lovely Runner Ep 5-6 Review: Byeon Woo Seok&#39;s sweet confession to Kim Hye Yoon turns sour; breaks hearts",1298995,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-3-4-review-kim-hye-yoon-byeon-woo-seoks-romance-is-heart-fluttering-twists-exciting-to-watch-1296237","articlepage","/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-5-6-review-byeon-woo-seoks-sweet-confession-to-kim-hye-yoon-turns-sour-breaks-hearts-1298995","Content Also read","entertainment","NA"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Lovely Runner Ep 5-6 Review: Byeon Woo Seok&#39;s sweet confession to Kim Hye Yoon turns sour; breaks hearts",1298995,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-3-4-review-kim-hye-yoon-byeon-woo-seoks-romance-is-heart-fluttering-twists-exciting-to-watch-1296237","articlepage","/entertainment/lovely-runner-ep-5-6-review-byeon-woo-seoks-sweet-confession-to-kim-hye-yoon-turns-sour-breaks-hearts-1298995","Lovely Runner Ep 3-4 Review: Kim Hye Yoon, Byeon Woo Seok’s romance is heart fluttering; twists exciting to watch","Also_Read","entertainment","NA")'><strong>Lovely Runner Ep 3-4 Review: Kim Hye Yoon, Byeon Woo Seok’s romance is heart fluttering; twists exciting to watch</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G8t7HLsmSrrZ6jsrN5xKlkbmVmYr%2BmwsiermaaqZq8r3nWqKZmq5WkuLR50rCcnqxdmLyvssSsqqKnnmLBsHnKoqRmoKmaerq7zqdkra2io8Buv86uqWaaopqurL%2BMoZyaqqSoenJ%2BmHFwcm0%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sean-pratt-ex-beach-jordi-16823437.html>&#171;&nbsp;NHS nurse caught stripping off online with racy OnlyFans account</a>
