Best Rapper Alive – Tha Carter II – Lil Wayne</h2><p class=align-left>A lot of pressure must come with dropping a track like “Best Rapper Alive”. But for Lil Wayne, the challenge provided an opportunity to prove that in 2005, he was the best rapper alive. At a young age, Wayne was always obsessed with the idea of becoming the best rapper, and he did things with this goal in mind. The song is from one of the best albums of all times ‘Tha Carter II’. Even though his rhymes are complex hence making them unknown, he is known for his versatility and consistency between schemes of rhymes and the way he does it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fbcfd3e8d0bd94e7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 greatest black opera singers of all time</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Top trending Drake songs 2018</p><h2>3.

Lil Wayne is not always known for his lyricism, but the song changes everything. It served as a reminder that he is still one of the greatest rappers alive. The 2011 track was almost at the end of his long reign as the king of hip-hop for nearly half a decade, and he went out with more power as he came in within the music scene.
