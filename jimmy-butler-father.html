So, the baby took the mother’s surname Butler.</p><p>Jordan then paid the mother huge money not to harm his public image, role model status, and the legacy he built.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, after 13 years, when payment stopped, the mother kicked the 13 years old child out of his.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, multiple gossip websites and youtube channels added their hypothesis to make things spicier.&nbsp;</p><p>Such as Butler was endorsed by the Jordan brand, and both were playing for <strong>Chicago Bulls</strong>; Butler looks more similar to Jordan than his actual two sons.&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>One evidence regarding this wildest rumor in the NBA is Michael Jordan played <strong>Houston</strong> in February 1989.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Butler was born in September, and no records state Butler was born prematurely.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Jordan paid handsome money to keep things secret, but Butler was raised poorly. So, if her mother had been paid well, they would have lived a better life.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Butler was kicked out of the house when he was 13 years old, his mother would have easily made money and fame if she had exposed Jordan.
