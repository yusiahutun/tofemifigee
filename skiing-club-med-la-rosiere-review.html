Here's everything you need to know</a></strong></p><p id=eQtqMmIHJKJD data-wc=84>The resort initially opened in December 2020, but due to travel restrictions, British media had never set foot through the door – until now. The hotel is located in the Espace San Bernardo, a vast ski area that straddles France's Savoie region and Italy's La Thuile resort, and boasts killer 180-degree views. Along with the genuinely panoramic views, the resort's slope-side convenience is undoubtedly the biggest draw for winter sports enthusiasts.

With its clever floor-to-ceiling windows throughout, this feature certainly made the most of its sunny south-facing view, a rarity for accommodation in the French Alps.</p><p id=eeC2t6mqT_6t data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Hit the slopes in style! 13 best stylish places to buy ski wear for women</a></strong></p><p id=eb9BTVprPHq4 data-wc=1><strong>DISCOVER: <a class=hm-link href=#>Time to hit the slopes! The top 7 places to ski this winter</a></strong></p><p id=ebQjYetVoSGr data-wc=27>The hotel boasts 395 rooms, two restaurants, a bar, kids' clubs, a wellness hub, a heated pool and a swanky Cinq Mondes spa, offering something for everyone.</p><p id=eNyRjbLBPFdx data-wc=54>Priding itself on its panoramic views, the hotel connects the main building with the rooms via a glass passageway. An Instagram lover's dream, walking down the see-through hallway didn't get old, and I was met with dozens of, 'Oh my god, where is this?,' messages on my phone every time I shared a photo.</p><p id=eooztLgvvc3V data-wc=47>Inside, the hotel is inspired by Savoyard architecture and traditions, seamlessly blending the traditional with modern touches. The Alpine décor extends to the rooms, complete with a cowbell feature, natural wood and cosy vibes, leading into a bathroom with double vanity sinks via a rustic saloon door.</p><p id=exMuoltSWPm- data-wc=19>The theme continues into the communal areas, where 3D fires blaze and statement lighting gives it a luxe feel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/533ddeec6df7-la-rosiere-pool-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ehbGg26ooD4w data-wc=6><strong>The hotel boasts killer 180-degree views</strong></p><h2><strong>What are the benefits of a Club Med holiday?</strong></h2><p id=e8jCWU5Hqm1R data-wc=49>Club Med might seem like an alien concept to most Brits, but it's one you should definitely get on board with. Famed for its all-inclusive package, Club Med has been an institution in France since the hotel brand was established in 1950, and it's one they're very proud of.</p><p id=eL5grm0i5iGm data-wc=68>Growing up in France, I have memories of quickly assimilating the Club Med lingo while meeting the ever-friendly 'Chef de Village' (the hotel manager – which translates to 'the village chief') and wandering around chatting to the 'G.M.' (great members aka guests), while the 'G.O.' (great organisers aka staff) tried to entice me (the lone unwilling and shy participant) into trying various activities and taking part in shows.</p><p id=exQei2L7iS8h data-wc=49>As an adult, the experience is a little different. The vibe is relaxed and fun, perfect for families or groups (kids under four stay free), and although the concept is French, Club Med draws an international crowd. And did I mention it's all-inclusive? This brings me onto the food.</p><h2><strong>What is the food like at Club Med La Rosière?</strong></h2><p id=eV1BKgNYY_nT data-wc=66>There are two restaurants: buffet-style dining at the main venue Le Mont Valsain, and the San Bernado gourmet lounge. Don't be fooled by the all-inclusive buffet, which usually translates to a selection of sad salads, overcooked meats and the odd 'local speciality' dish. Club Med La Rosière offers an impressively vast menu, mostly consisting of Franco Italian cuisine – and there was nothing sad about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b9e4a7d6cd64-la-rosiere-dining-room-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eumHSLHMBiER data-wc=9><strong>Dining with a view in the Mont Valsain restaurant</strong></p><p id=etBcVmm1OJjJ data-wc=34>The Mont Valsain was a familiar hub after a hard morning on the slopes; providing endless choices of unlimited food and drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner, every meal turned into a five-course experience.</p><p id=ePyZnM0oxkaM data-wc=1><strong>PHOTOS: <a class=hm-link href=#>Royals in chic skiwear! Princess Diana, Sarah Ferguson, Princess Eugenie & more</a></strong></p><p id=edUlyX4LEiXy data-wc=41>The highlight for me was the Italian station serving up crispy pizzas and pasta dishes daily, not to mention the dessert counter featuring daily local specialities. The cream-filled choux pastry of the Paris-Brest was *chefs kiss* and deserves a shout out.</p><p id=eNwiwCgz7fZJ data-wc=34>There are plenty of gooey Savoyard specialities on offer too, including raclette and tartiflette, but if you're looking for something a little fancier, it's worth booking a table at the San Bernado gourmet lounge.</p><p id=eh4SLJaNz8K2 data-wc=51>This venue had more of a relaxed atmosphere, complete with dim lighting, jazz musicians and a la carte menu, which was supplemented by an authentic Savoyard menu, including a pretty tasty cheese fondue. Meals at the San Bernardo are included in the all-inclusive package, but need to be booked in advance.</p><p id=eLzBbvFnRugW data-wc=25>If you're in need of a pre-dinner drink, the spacious lounge and bar at the hub of the hotel await, and yes, alcohol included.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e9d2b375b9e3-la-rosiere-bedroom-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=euTuOqiE8clW data-wc=6><strong>The all-inclusive hotel boasts 395 rooms</strong></p><h2><strong>What is skiing like at Club Med La Rosière?</strong></h2><p id=eSr1UXamNWl3 data-wc=47>This is where the hotel really comes into its own. As a very rusty but once confident skier, I was excited to be given a first look at the slopes surrounding the resort. First impressions were strong, especially since ski-in/ski-out access is so rare in French resorts.</p><p id=e_UlOHyoR3zO data-wc=75>Club Med's new Covid safety measures mean that your ski gear is already waiting for you in your locker. The ski shop and adjoining boot room lead straight from the hotel onto the slopes – you simply put your skis on and you're off. Having experienced dozens of resorts where a gondola ride or a long, blister-incurring walk uphill is necessary, the benefits of this can't be ignored, especially if you're travelling with young kids.</p><p id=eXMgZK5FmXhk data-wc=75>The resort is perfect for beginners, with a designated area and children's ski park located next to the ski room, as well as gentle slopes surrounding the resort. And if skiing's not your cup of tea, there are plenty more winter sports on offer, from snowboarding to cross-country skiing and hiking. Due to its south-facing nature, La Rosière is famed for being exceptionally sunny, as well as having a higher snowfall compared to nearby resorts.</p><p id=e1JgY2Nvenr4 data-wc=54>Another Club Med benefit is the ski pass, which is included in the all-inclusive package. A full price Espace San Bernado ski pass, which allows you access to 5.2 km of ski routes and all areas in La Rosière and neighbouring La Thuile, will set you back 239€, with discounts for children and seniors.</p><p id=eZS-9NQlaZ_W><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/55993fdee06b-la-rosiere-swimming-pool-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=ek2il3PuZA7 data-wc=7><strong>The view from the pool is incredible</strong></p><h2><strong>What are the spa facilities like at Club Med La Rosière</strong><strong>?</strong></h2><p id=e4FfyRCWWoa data-wc=49>It wouldn't be a four-star resort without a pool and wellness centre to unwind in after a day on the slopes, and Club Med La Rosière didn't disappoint. I went for a solo post-ski swim in the heated indoor pool, gazing out across the snowy mountains as dusk fell.</p><p id=eitTvLX-2Kg data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Ski boots: how to get the perfect fit</a></strong></p><p id=efhqh887IFu6 data-wc=43>If I'm honest, I didn't do much swimming and mostly watched the spectacular view from the floor-to-ceiling windows. There is also a kids' paddling pool as well as a hammam and jacuzzi, but these were sadly closed during my stay (another Covid casualty).</p><p id=eAobDfeS7GVO data-wc=22>The Cinq Mondes Spa by Club Med is located right next to the pool, providing a welcome escape for a pre-dinner massage.</p><p id=e3xD5ZLpyiJR data-wc=30>For those of you who can't bear to ditch your training regime, there's a gym and packed class schedule including HIIT on offer, not to mention the ByHeberson yoga studio.</p><p id=eBZIrVliXns4 data-wc=35>A yoga lesson was not something I've had the chance to do during a skiing holiday before and provided a welcome change. I was taught Vibhava Yoga and breathing methods, emerging in a meditative state.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ab18d1b2199f-la-rosiere-more-views-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eyc2c6qIDBSr data-wc=8><strong>Club Med has a great Covid-19 cancellation policy</strong></p><h2><strong>What is travel to France like amid the Covid-19 pandemic?</strong></h2><p id=esaQHos6Txz2 data-wc=38>Club Med La Rosière is easily accessible from the international airports of Geneva and Lyon (a 2.5-hour drive away) and from the Bourg-Saint-Maurice TGV high-speed train station (35 minutes) if you'd rather catch the Eurostar into Paris first.</p><p id=eDhqCPum6Ndn data-wc=63>Yes, travelling might seem like a hassle right now. Totalling up the cost of PCR tests and scouring government websites for travel advice is enough to test anyone's nerves. The rules about Covid tests changed while we were out there, a foreshadowing of France's ban on all non-essential travel from the UK that came on December 15, which has now thankfully been reversed.</p><p id=eAtdBMmOb4Lj data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>6 best child-friendly ski resorts for a perfect family holiday</a></strong></p><p id=epuSLUPgbDxv data-wc=18>The 2022 ski season will definitely be pushing ahead, however.
