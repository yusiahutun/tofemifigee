Dannel P.

He said Monday that Lanza took his last class in the summer of 2009 and didn't return.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Investigators have offered no motive, and police have found no letters or diaries that could shed light on it. They believe Lanza attended Sandy Hook many years ago, but they couldn't explain why he went there Friday. Authorities said Lanza had no criminal history, and it was not clear whether he had a job.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Lanza is believed to have used a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle in the school attack, a civilian version of the military's M-16 and a model commonly seen at marksmanship competitions. It's similar to the weapon used in a recent shopping mall shooting in Oregon.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Versions of the AR-15 were outlawed in the United States under the 1994 assault weapons ban. That law expired in 2004, and Congress, in a nod to the political clout of the gun-rights lobby, did not renew it.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>In some of the first regulatory proposals to rise out of the Newtown shooting, Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Joe Lieberman said Sunday that military-style assault weapons should be banned and that a national commission should be established to examine mass shootings.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>'Assault weapons were developed for the U.S. military, not commercial gun manufacturers,' said Lieberman, of Connecticut, who is retiring next month. 'This is a moment to start a very serious national conversation about violence in our society, particularly about these acts of mass violence.'</span><br></p><p><span>Gun rights activists remained largely quiet, all but one declining to appear on the Sunday talk shows. In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, defended the sale of assault weapons and said that the principal at Sandy Hook, who authorities say died trying to overtake the shooter, should herself have been armed.</span></p><p><span>Photography agencies confirmed to MailOnline that their presence was allowed at Monday's funerals provided they remained at a respectful distance.<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/17/article-2249497-168E485B000005DC-366_634x401.jpg height=401 width=634 alt="A man pays his respects near a U.S. flag donning the names of victims on a makeshift memorial in Sandy Hook village" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>A man pays his respects near a U.S. flag donning the names of victims on a makeshift memorial in Sandy Hook village</p><p><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fc4CYbXBwZ4OWu6XFjIGmqKNdqLWwu9OipaBleWKxsLrTZqKnp6ditLC1zaBkgKqRo7Guu9OhnKtlpp6wtbXMZqmerpWWubR5x56Yq6ySp7Kit8innmarpKS%2FunnPqKCgppGjwW61zJqenmWdpLqmutNmnqKqnKh6sa3RnqWtq12pvK2wjJ2cmpxencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./taylor-swifts-most-iconic-cmt-performances-head-turning-outfits-over-the-years.html>&#171;&nbsp;Taylor Swifts most iconic CMT performances - see her head-turning outfits over the years</a>
