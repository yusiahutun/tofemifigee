That’s really evident, and it’s not something you can always count on, unfortunately. It’s either there, or it’s not, and we have it, so it allows us to work in a way that is respectful of one another,” to TV Line in 2020.</p><p>While the duo has an undeniably good on-screen chemistry, they never dated each other.
