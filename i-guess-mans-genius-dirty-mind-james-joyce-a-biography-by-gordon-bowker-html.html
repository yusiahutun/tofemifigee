At least among the pastures of Eng Lit studies, which the cunning old devil supplied with enough mystifying codes and clues, Homeric references and layers of meaning to keep them happy writing commentaries and setting exam papers ’til kingdom come.</p><p>Begorrah, the man could write, no question of that. But have I read him as I ought to have? Afraid not.</p><p>Many-a-time I’ve dipped into Ulysses, especially the crystal opening pages, set in the Martello tower on Dublin Bay, Mr Bloom’s breakfast kidney, the newspaper office, the theatrics of the brothels of Nighttown, yes and Molly Bloom’s final soliloquy, indeed yes. But straight through from start to finish? For 933 pp? Well, have you?</p><p>As for Finnegans Wake, which it would take a whole Bletchley Park to unpack and de-code, somehow I’ve never had the time. Or the ability. Or the inclination.</p><p>Give me rather the short stories, Dubliners, or A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. There you have the very smell of ‘dear, dirty Dublin’.</p><p>Joyce gave up most of his life to creating these masterpieces. This biography, naturally, is about the rest of it, how he lived in the intervals when he wasn’t laying face-down on a bed writing for up to 12 hours a day.</p><p>Here is his boyhood, dominated by the fearsome Jesuits who taught him and by his father, one of life’s loveably hopeless cases. He began as a man of property and proceeded to squander it all on extravagant house-moving (there were nine addresses in 11 years) and sociable carousing.</p><p>James described both Jesuits and father unforgettably in A Portrait, the sermons and the beatings at school, the musical evenings at home with song and dance and charades when his father had not been carried home legless.</p><p>Though he was pale, studious and fearful, James’ nickname was not ‘sunny Jim’ for nothing. His brilliance was obvious - the Jesuits tried to recruit him to their order. But by then his voracious reading had discovered Ibsen.</p><p>Casting off the fear and guilt of his Catholic upbringing he went to study languages at Dublin’s University College and turned into an aloof young dandy with broad-brimmed hat and ashplant cane, head tilted up at an arrogant angle.</p><p>But the father would out. Joyce’s tenor voice was much admired. He would sing sentimental Irish ballads to his own piano accompaniment. According to his brother and fellow student, Stanislaus, he would see the night out ‘dancing, singing, laughing, reciting and revelling’.</p><p>It was not long, he told his brother, before his first sexual encounter with a prostitute on a canal bank. Thereafter, he became a regular customer in Dublin’s brothel quarter which he called Nighttown.</p><p>He was to repeat his father’s pattern all his life. When he left Dublin for sojourns in Trieste, Zurich and Paris he changed his address continually. No matter how hard-up, he constantly moved from one hotel or flat to another and indulged himself in restaurants and partying while the debts piled up.</p><p>But Joyce owed his career primarily to women, three in particular. First and foremost was Nora Barnacle, the hotel maid from Galway whom he accosted in the street because of her auburn hair. He was immediately besotted with her. On their first evening out, she ‘took him in hand’. In gratitude, he kept as an icon the glove that she had removed.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/06/16/article-0-00D782951000044C-28_233x423.jpg height=423 width=233 alt="The maid from Galway: Nora Barnacle became Joyce's muse and his wife" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The maid from Galway: Nora Barnacle became Joyce's muse and his wife</p><p>That day,&nbsp; June 16, 1904, was to be commemorated in Ulysees as ‘Bloomsday’. The following October they eloped together to the Continent. He picked up a living teaching at Berlitz language schools, mainly in Trieste, while he began his first novel.</p><p>Nora, his muse and the model for Molly Bloom, was never impressed with his work - when she bothered to read it. She scolded him like any Irish housewife when he was brought home legless like his father before him.</p><p>‘I guess the man’s a genius,’ she said after reading the closing pages of Ulysees, ‘but what a dirty mind he has surely?’</p><p>She had reason to know. During his one return to Ireland with their son, Giorgio, he wrote to her a series of longing letters of unabashed lust (not quoted) including masochistic fantasies about her as well as insecurities about her sexual past.</p><p>She was his ‘sweet little whorish Nora’ - but like Leopold Bloom and his Molly he tormented himself with thoughts of who else might have enjoyed her. They finally married on a visit to London in 1931 to secure his children’s’ inheritance.</p><p>The two other women champions were his first publishers. One was Syliva Beach, a young American bookseller. Her Left Bank shop, Shakespeare and Company, which was Joyce’s favourite haunt, published Ulysees on his 40th birthday on February 2, 1922, in an edition of 1,000 copies. A larger edition was brought out by Harriet Weaver, whose Egoist Press had already serialised some of it.</p><p>The book was promptly banned both in Britain and the United States (until the Thirties), but smuggled copies ensured that it got reviewed by such names as T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. They were respectful if not awed.</p><p>The Catholic Dublin Review was predictably hostile: ‘An Odyssey of the Sewer, anti-Christian, totally immoral, unreadable, unquotable and unreviewable.’ Joyce was pleased by that.</p><p>Ulysees was more obscene than any non-underground novel that had appeared by that time. But its experimental stream of consciousness method and huge literary talent won most critics over and re-set the boundaries of acceptability for the future.</p><p>But it didn’t, for a long time, bring in any money. That was provided in loan upon loan from Joyce’s champion and saviour, Harriet Weaver. She continued nobly to dig him out of his financial holes even after she realised how much he squandered on meals, taxis and hotel suites.</p><p>To be fair, a lot was also spent on his failing eyesight, which a series of operations failed to improve. Even more was spent trying to improve the mental state of his adored daughter Lucia, in whom he thought he saw signs of genius, but who had frequent hysterical breakdowns. She was diagnosed as schizophrenic and ended her life in an English mental hospital.</p><p>Famous as he had become, Joyce’s later years were sad ones. He found it progressively harder to see to write. He and Nora struggled out of France ahead of the Germans to Zurich, where he soon died of a perforated ulcer in 1941, aged 59.</p><p>This sound, hefty biography is enjoyable and fair but at times it is weighed down with Gypsy Joyce’s changes of address and suchlike boring detail. It refrains from passing judgement. At least that saves us from hagiography. But it does lack warmth. So, I suspect, did Joyce - like many a man of genius, obsessed by his work.</p><p><a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/tm/2009/11/03/buy-this-book.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCforJwrs6ooqxnkafBqq%2FLnmRraGBpgHd9joJkoK2VqMBuucCnqmaflaO2tr%2BMZpuiqqSueq61zZ1kg3l9eqBulq6Sen5lcWKPipumi3iJgIlij5p5poiJfYd%2BYo%2BQo6p%2BiWegpKK5</p></div><div id=links><a href=./banks-violette-wrecked-chandelier-self-portraits-celine.html>&#171;&nbsp;Back with a crash bang: Banks Violette on his wrecked chandelier self-portraits</a>
