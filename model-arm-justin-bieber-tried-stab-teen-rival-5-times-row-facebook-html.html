I am friends with her on Facebook and I saw some of the stuff she posted, but I had no idea she was famous. It’s so weird.</span></p><p><span>‘She definitely doesn’t look the same. She didn’t even have blonde hair. She was just a regular girl, who used to drive her mum’s mini-van to soccer practice. Thinking of her in a Lamborghini is strange.</span></p><p><span>‘She had a long term boyfriend through high school. She wasn’t a party girl, she wasn’t even that popular, she was always in the background. The other girls would go out and they’d ask her if she wanted to come and she would say, ‘No, I don’t think so’.</span></p><p><span>‘She always looked really young and when I knew her she wouldn’t wear anything provocative, she didn’t even wear much make-up. She would just dress in jeans, t-shirts and sweaters.</span></p><p><span>‘As far as I remember she graduated early, so she was pretty smart. I had no idea about the stabbing claims, but that seems so out of character.</span></p><p><span>‘It seems like she just left Virginia in the past when she moved, I don’t think she ever looked back and she never mentions that she’s from here. That has upset a few people.’</span></p><p><span>Another school friend, Matthew Hovey said: ‘I didn't know how well she was doing for herself "fame wise" and I'm shocked to hear she was supposed to have stabbed a girl. The girl I knew was never really confrontational.

Darliene and Tia Renzulli say Chantel used to boast that she had been forced to move to Jacksonville because she had got into trouble on the West Coast.</span></p><p><span>But even after settling in Jacksonville, some people saw her as a normal, well-behaved girl. She worked as a waitress at Marrakesh, a middle-eastern restaurant less than a mile from her house. Her old boss Sami Raman remembers her fondly.</span></p><p><span>He said: ‘I worked with her for about a year and she was just a normal girl. I knew her dad well and he is a great guy. They’re a good family. She went to work, went to community college across the street to study pharmaceuticals and then went home.</span></p><p><span>‘One of my friends still talks to her and he said that the night Bieber was arrested she had been working, doing a video, she wasn’t drunk, she’d done nothing wrong.
