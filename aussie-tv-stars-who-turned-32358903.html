She joined the soap in 2005 before departing four years later in 2009.</p><p>The 33-year-old continued her acting career, portraying Lady Kenna in the CW series Reign and Laura Weever in the short film Laura Hasn't Slept in 2020. The following year, Caitlin confirmed she was taking a break from acting and instead, ventured into the explicit film industry.</p><p>Caitlin is now a director and writer at the female-owned pornography studio Afterglow. Sharing more information about the company, she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Women’s Wear Daily</a>: It’s a queer-run and operated company. It’s a very cool group of women making some very good stuff."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32204515.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_MAIN-Neighbours-legend-48-shows-of-age-defying-beauty.jpg><p>Last year, she opened up about what it's like to work in the adult industry world. “The content is pretty intense," the former soap star told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>I've Got News for You podcast</a>. "But it runs just like any other film set."</p><p>Caitlin added: “But it runs just like any other film set. The sets tend to be really inclusive. There's a lot of women. In fact, I think there are more female directors in pornography than there are in mainstream film and television."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>The star also revealed how inspiration from a perfume advert led her to creating a lesbian porn film. She explained: "You know whenever you watch a commercial for a perfume and you’re like, ‘this makes zero sense!’</p><p>"It feels like they’re written by an algorithm on another planet. But they’re always so sexy and it always feels like sex is about to happen – everyone’s sniffing each other’s necks and licking each other’s wrists." Caitlin added: "So I kind of came up with the concept of a perfume commercial that then becomes a lesbian threesome."</p><h3>Scarlet Vas</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32366444.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_NEIGHBOURS-TV-Programme.jpg><p>Adult model Scarlet Vas is also a former resident of Ramsay Street. She played police officer Mishti Sharma from 2017 to 2018. In 2021, the LA-based actress announced she had joined subscription-based website <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>OnlyFans</a>.</p><p>She offers her exclusive content for $23.74 for 31 days. Scarlet, 28, has so far shared a total of 172 posts on the platform, but they can only be viewed by paying customers. The actress is also somewhat of a <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>TikTok</a> sensation, boasting more than five million followers on the social media app.</p><h3>Shelby Mills</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32366455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS228860499.jpg><p><a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Love Island</a> Australia star Shelby 'Bilby' Mills appeared on series one of the show in 2018. After finding fame on the dating programme, Shelby found huge success on OnlyFans.</p><p>In 2020, the reality star revealed she had launched her own X-rated website. For $4.99 a month, subscribers have access to exclusive content and unlimited chat. The site also promised content such as "t*ts revealed" as well as unseen material.</p><h3>Caitlin McConville</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32366456.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-164252.jpg><p>Caitlin McConville officially joined OnlyFans in 2023 - the same year she appeared on Married at First Sight. The season 10 bride charges $24.99 for a monthly subscription on the platform.</p><p>The Brisbane-based makeup artist admitted she told producers that she had been an adult entertainer in the past, however the footage was never aired. She told Yahoo Lifestyle: "Shannon [Adams] and I actually had a conversation about me being an adult entertainer in the past, and [the producers] asked us to have that conversation on camera.</p><p>"This sort of stuff was had on camera, it just wasn't used." Caitlin re-activated her account almost one year after signing up to the dating show.</p><p>Opening up about why she joined OnlyFans, Caitlin said: “I'm very sex-positive, I'm very progressive, I'm very, ‘Do what makes you happy and make money however makes you happy’ – and that's with everything. If you like to travel the world and want to blog it and you make money off it, do it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32366484.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screenshot-706.png><p>"If you’re a beauty influencer, do it. Just do what makes your soul sing, I don't judge people.” Caitlin confessed she was hesitant to rejoin in the platform because of how it would be perceived by the public.</p><p>She explained: "I'm not gonna lie, at first I was kind of like, do I do this again knowing I'm going to get a lot of hate and bite back from the public because of the stigma around it?” she reflects. “Do I really want to deal with that? Is that going to be good for my mental health?</p><p>“But at the same time, I had people remind me like, ‘Caitlin, you are who you are, and don't change that because of people's negative opinions. And the people who will support you will support you and the people who don't won’t’.”</p><p>Caitlin followed in her co-star Bronte Schofield's footsteps, who charges $25.99 for a monthly subscription. The MAFS AUS star revealed that she earned a whopping $100,000 in just three days on the racy platform.</p><h3>Hayley Vernon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32366500.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-153026.jpg><p>After finding fame on Married at First Sight in 2020, Hayley Vernon decided to head down a different career path. She was one of the first Aussie reality stars to join OnlyFans, and revealed she made a staggering $1.3million in her first two years.</p><p>After making $90,000 in her first month alone, Hayley admitted to blowing thousands on superficial purchases - something she later regretted. She then told Yahoo Lifestyle: "Even though I make great money, I have to be smart. The money I earn now is not going to last forever."</p><p><i><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b>Want all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox? </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>Sign up for our free Daily Star Showbiz newsletter</b></a><b>.</b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZK62v9KinGaspmLAta3RrGSwoJ9iwba%2BzZ6bZmtiaIJ5hY9s</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chinese-university-hong-kongs-rocky-tuan-resigns-vice-chancellor.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chinese University of Hong Kong president Rocky Tuan quits, cites opportune time after governi</a>
