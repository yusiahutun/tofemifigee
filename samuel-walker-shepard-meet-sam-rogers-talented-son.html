He is ‘Hollywood royalty’ because he was born to two world-famous Hollywood actors. His father, Sam Shepard, was a famous actor, playwright, and director, while his mother, Jessica Lange, is a world-renowned Oscar-winning actress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SAMMMMMM-683x1024.jpg><p>Samuel grew up with his famous family, comprising his parents, his two siblings, Hannah Jane Shepard and Jesse Mojo Shepard, and his half-brother Shura Baryshnikov from his mother’s former relationship.</p><p>His sister, Hannah Jane Shepard, is only a year older than Samuel, and the two are always mistaken for twins.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Samuel_Walker_Shepard_Attend_College></span>Did Samuel Walker Shepard Attend College?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Most details of Samuel’s educational background and early life are unknown, but reports have confirmed that he attended college. Due to the fame of both his parents, Samuel grew up in the public eye and has been known by many worldwide since his birth.</p><p>Besides being a celebrity kid, fans love Samuel because of his stunning eyes, just like <a href=#>Alexandra Daddario</a>. Samuel took up a career in the music industry, much to the surprise of many who expected him to become an actor like his parents. His siblings, Hannah and Jesse, did not also follow in their parents’ footsteps in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Hannah became an academic professor after studying writing at Sarah Lawrence College, and Jesse, 17 years older than Samuel, is an accomplished writer with a handful of books in his name.&nbsp;</p><p>While all three kids did not enter Hollywood, they are satisfied and successful in their chosen careers. Over the years, Samuel and his elder sister, Hannah, lived in Virginia and moved to Minnesota, New Mexico, and New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SAM-AND-HANNAH.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Samuel_Walker_Shepards_Band></span>Samuel Walker Shepard’s Band<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After graduating college, Samuel pursued his passion for music and joined a New York-based band, The Down Hill Strugglers, formerly The Dust Busters, in 2008. He is a skilled musician and an expert at playing numerous instruments like the guitar, banjo, fiddle, and harmonica.</p><p>This has contributed to his band’s incredible mission to bring back the spirit of Old Time Music through their electrifying performances.&nbsp;The band consists of members Jackson Lynch, Eli Smith, and occasional groupie John Cohen. Together, they have achieved impressive feats in the industry and have also performed in iconic venues like the Jalopy Theatre and the Club Passim, to name a few.</p><p>The band has also appeared on radio shows and music festivals, such as the Brooklyn Folk Festival and Woodstock Film Festival.&nbsp;The Down Hill Strugglers have made a name for themselves in the music industry, with Samuel being a standout member.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of their famous music include “The Dust Buster,” “Old Man Below,” and “Show Me The Way To Go Home.” Samuel and his group won the Independent Music Award in 2013 for “Old Man Below.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Samuel_Walker_Shepards_Instagram_and_Twitter></span>Samuel Walker Shepard’s Instagram and Twitter&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Considering his fame, the musician has kept quite a private life.
