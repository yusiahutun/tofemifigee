It is a medium blonde strawberry hair color that comes with an ammonia-free formula, and covers all your gray hair for a stunning result. In this kit, you will get a hair color, a developer, 2 pairs of latex gloves, shampoo and conditioner packets, stain guard and stain remover, and an instruction manual to help you make the process easier.</p><p>Pros</p><ul class=pros_list><li>Premium formula</li><li>Paraben-free</li><li>All-in-one kit</li><li>Colorist-approved</li><li>Boosts softness</li><li>Cruelty-free</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul class=cons_list><li>Hard-to-open color bottle</li></ul><p>Now that you have taken a look at the products I have curated, here's how to choose the best one for yourself —</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Choose the Best Strawberry Blonde Hair Dye?</h2></p><p>Below are the parameters to consider before buying the best strawberry blonde hair dye -&nbsp;</p><p><strong>a) Formula- </strong>If you are someone who likes to do their bit for the environment, a clean formula free of ammonia, PPD, phthalates, paraben, acetate could be your answer to healthy hair. If you have sensitive scalp, on the other hand, a vegan-friendly formula is what you need to grab to ensure the proper care of your hair length and roots. But if you have dry and damaged strands, looking for a moisturizing formula packed with nourishing ingredients can work like magic.</p><p><strong>b) Longevity- </strong>There are plenty of hair colors with several longevity claims- permanent, semi-permanent, temporary, one time use, etc. If you would like to keep the hair color for the longest possible time, choosing a permanent hair dye is wise. Semi or demi permanent hair colors fade away faster than permanent hair colors that usually last 6-8 weeks. On the other hand, a one time hair color is a clever option to get the color for just a day with no regrets.</p><p><strong>c) Shade- </strong>Strawberry blonde hair colors are available in multiple shades to begin with. But before you pick yours, make sure you are aware of your own skin tone so that the color looks more attractive and appealing. Your undertone plays the biggest role here, let me tell you how! If you have a warm undertone, choose a cooler pinkish tone shade. On the other hand, people with cool undertones should pick a shade with coral tint for a more attractive look. And for neutral undertones, all kinds of shades will make them look stand out!</p><p>Now take a look at how you can get the desired color at the comfort of your home—</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Get Strawberry Blonde Hair Color at Home Effortlessly?</h2></p><p>Here's how you can dye your hair strawberry blonde at home effortlessly -&nbsp;</p><p>a) First thing first, before you start, wrap an old cloth around your shoulder up to your chest to avoid any mess out of your coloring session.</p><p>b) Now, comb your hair with a wide toothed brush that will help the hair to get partitioned nicely.</p><p>c) Now, take some vaseline or coconut oil and apply around the edges of your hairline so that no stain is left on the face or ears.</p><p>d) Now, take out the gloves given in the package. Even if it doesn't offer one, get yourself one to avoid an embarrassing stain on the hand.</p><p>e) Now, take out the base color, and mix it with the developer, if any.</p><p>f) If it is henna color, I recommend letting it soak overnight in warm water for the ultimate result.</p><p>g) Now, take a small section of your hair, and start applying the color from root to tip. Or, as directed in the user guide.</p><p>h) Apply the color as prescribed in the direction.</p><p>i) Now, wash the color thoroughly before proceeding with the next step.</p><p>j) Lastly, apply conditioner to your hair to get soft strands.</p><p>k) I recommend skipping shampoo on the day you have applied hair color to get the best result out of your hair color.</p><p>Now take a look at how you can take good care of your colored tresses—</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Care for Your Hair Dyed Strawberry Blonde?</h2></p><p>Here's how you can take care of your hair dyed strawberry blonde -&nbsp;</p><p>a) <strong>Picking color-friendly products</strong> is step one! Choose shampoos and conditioners that are compatible with colored strands.</p><p>b) You should always use a <strong>hair serum that is moisturizing</strong> as blonde hair tends to appear drier than it is.</p><p>c) You must always <strong>apply a heat protectant</strong> before blow drying or hair straightening or curling.</p><p>d) <strong>Use a hair mask</strong> once a week to ensure better moisturization of your strands.</p><p>e) You must <strong>pick a toner</strong> to maintain the vibrancy in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>So, that's it!
