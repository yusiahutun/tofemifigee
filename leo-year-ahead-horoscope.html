And if not, you may have had to learn the art of taking the stage by being given the unwanted role once or twice. Like you, the sun is generous with it's light, illuminating the world and giving life. Similarly your creativity and leadership ability will require recognition. And yes, problems will ensue when your light goes unrecognized—then there is what we may call a solar flare or an eclipse of the sun.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So dear Leo, in the most idyllic world, you are positioned in life in a way where you can exert your creative powers and be well regarded for your output of light in the world. It is your job, after all, to shine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>The Big Picture</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Your year will begin with a bright New Moon in Leo which will kick things off with a newfound sense of stability as Saturn aligns to help you to anchor your new vision for this year to come. Set your yearly intentions the week of August 1 and write them down as this New Moon carries staying power. From September 2016 through September 2017, your greatest luck will shine in areas of networking and establishing new alliances. This should not be hard for you as you tend to present yourself with flying colors. Though you may need to get away from the screens more often and meet these VIP's in person to show them you mean business. The people you meet this year may well guide you in fortuitous directions and help you very much. So do stay open to socializing more. Saturn will remain in the sector of love, showing a distinct lack of 'options' though simultaneously this means there is a strong prospect of commitment to one serious person. It will not be about 'playing the field' for you this year, instead it will be about recognizing what true partnership is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Career & Money</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is your year to earn the income you deserve for the creative work you have been doing. Being a sign that appreciates the finer things in life, you may be pleased to know that, this summer, your funds will be growing sufficiently. An eclipse will light up the sector of money and value in your chart and this area will remain lit up for the year to come. This Solar Eclipse will occur on September 1st and it is very possible that a glowing opportunity will emerge that week. However, astrology is a 2-way street so perhaps you will feel inspired to create this new revenue stream. There is one catch though, as Mercury will be retrograde throughout September in your house of finances. That means you may be renegotiating for a while in thus time and it will be best to wait until after September 23 to sign off on any new contracts or campaigns.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A Lunar Eclipse mid-September will ask you to make an investment in your creativity or a certain amount of money may need to be allotted to a child or a future creative project. It is possible that this happens by surprise. However Septembers' financial focus will be inciting a much bigger financial overhaul that has been long-overdue for you. You will have to let go of an old money story in order to walk into a spectrum of much greater possibility. It's time to raise the roof, Leo. By March of 2017, you will have done the heavy lifting as you will be ready to emerge in an entirely new financial eco-system, one that is less dependent on your daily efforts. Perhaps this will be because of an investment or a new business model that is more time efficient. And at last a New Moon in the end of April will point to a pinnacle career moment and elevation of your status in the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Love & Romance</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Being a fire sign and one ruled by the Sun, romance and passion must grow and flare throughout your life or else, life is simply lackluster. This year, love will certainly become more articulated than before, as for the first time in 8 years, eclipses will ease their way into Leo and your partner sign, Aquarius. The initial 'partner eclipse' will occur mid-August and this will punctuate the breaking or making of a bond for you. If a relationship has been wavering, you seem to be getting the absolute clarity one way or the other. You must trust the way things 'land' here and it also appears to be a positive turn of events, perhaps involving international travel or a business partnership that will open you up to international markets. Now, let's fast forward to December where the first 2 weeks will brim with feelings of love as your romance meter will be off the charts. And at last there is a healthy dose of drama and flair to your love life as February brings swift changes that make commitment feel like it is on your terms. The Lunar Eclipse in Leo mid-February shows a healthy blend of independence and commitment with the friendly angles made to both serious Saturn and exciting Uranus. It seems that this relationship will be quite supportive and you can trust the sudden turn of events here.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Home & Real Estate</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In early November a real estate opportunity may pique your interest. Follow this hunch as a friendly angle from Neptune will point to help from banks or other possible leniency in negotiations. This may as well, be time to make a home related investment. However, you will do well to wait until October of 2017 to buy as that is when Jupiter, planet of luck, will be favoring all real estate purchases and home endeavors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For more from Rebecca go to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mypathastrology.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=mypathastrology.com class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">mypathastrology.com</a>, or follow her on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.facebook.com/mypathastrology data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Facebook class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Facebook</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.twitter.com/mypathastrology data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Twitter class="body-el-link standard-body-el-link body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Twitter</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/fff9dbcd-eb84-4932-8461-f287e3ccb154.jpg alt="Headshot of Rebecca Gordon" title="Headshot of Rebecca Gordon" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As the exclusive astrologer for Harper’s Bazaar, Rebecca Gordon brings the highlights of cosmic news to you as it happens in the skies above.
