Hence, in December 2022, he is 43 years old.</p><h3><strong>Mikel Welch Family</strong></h3><p>The family members of Mikel Welch (real name Michael Welch), include his father Winston Welch, and Kathy Young-Welch. Raised in a very conservative family, his father Mikel worked as a minister and Kathy was a radio personality and TV anchor. On his Facebook in 2019, Mikel shared that he grew up in the Detroit area and his dad always live for the weekends so he could manicure the lawn during the Spring season.</p><p>Winston, born in 1954, is currently 68 years of age. On Father’s Day 2023, Mikel wished his dad, “Happy Father’s Day to the incredible man who has always been my role model, my support, and my biggest cheerleader. Thank you for being the best dad I could ever ask for.”</p><p>His wife turned 67 in February 2023. Kathy has spoken of her son’s career with Detroit News. She told the outlet that Mikel “had an eye for architecture and unique design.”</p><p>“We might be going for a drive as a family and any type of building that was architecturally different he was always drawn to those,” Mikel, a retired broadcast news journalist and public affairs specialist. “He would say ‘When I grow up, that’s the kind of house I want to live in.’ And it was always something that was extremely different.”</p><p>Kathy inspired her son to follow his passion for designing. “She said you need to find your passion,” Mikel told Detroit News. “She said you’ll know what it is because you’d be willing to do it for free.”</p><h3><strong>How Tall Is Mikel Welch?</strong></h3><p>Mikel Welch’s height measures under 5’9”.</p><h3><strong>Mikel Welch Partner</strong></h3><p>First off, Mikel Welch is a member of the LGBTQ community. He came out as a gay man in his sophomore year of college and found it to be a very challenging experience. The struggle was made worse by growing up in a fairly traditional family with a minister as the head of the household.</p><p>Mikel claims that although his parents first attempted to blame his enrollment at an exclusively male college for his sexual orientation, they “eventually came around, over time.”</p><p>Speaking with Pride, about being gay in the design industry, Mikel explained, “I went to college in the south, in Atlanta. There’s a joke that if you go outside of the 20-minute circle, you’re in Georgia; the rest is Atlanta. When I step outside that bubble and go into a Hancock Fabrics or something like that—yes, in smaller towns, it is not as accepting. You’re going to have a harder time.”</p><p>He concluded, “Not that I would walk in there raising a flag. But the jokey manner that I have, I may not have that going in there. I might tone down myself to make it more palatable to them—not that I should. It’s a toning down and being aware of where I’m at and how it’ll be a bit easier.”</p><p>The Cinemaholic reported that Mikel appears single and there is no evidence of him being in a relationship at the time of this article. He is also unmarried and doesn’t have any kids.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Mikel Welch Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Per Twitter, Mikel Welch celebrates his birthday on 14 December.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Mikel Welch From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Mikel Welch is originally from Detroit, Michigan.
