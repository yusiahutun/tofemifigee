However, according to his birth documents, his birth name is James Elliot Karz.</p><p>Not much is known about his family, but some reports claim he was raised alongside a brother with whom he shares a deep bond.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Jimmy_Karz></span>How Old Is Jimmy Karz?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The talented man was born on July 26, 1984, which makes him 38 years old in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_the_Kid_in_%E2%80%9CMatilda%E2%80%9D></span>Who Is the Kid in “Matilda?”&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There were many kids of note in the comedic film. However, some that stand out include the girl Matilda, whom the show was named after, and Bruce Bogtrotter, who became her cohort.&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda was played by Mara Wilson, who had been featured in some other films prior, but Jimmy Karz’s participation in the movie was his debut in the acting world. In the film, his character stole their villainous headmistress’ cake, and he was forced to eat a whole cake in front of the entire class.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds enjoyable, but Bogtrotter soon gets sick of eating it and would have given up if he did not get encouragement from Matilda. He finished the cake and ultimately became great friends with Matilda.</p><p>They went on to get payback against the wicked headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull.&nbsp;Karz was a child when he played Bogtrotter. However, he deviated from acting when he got older and has become something else entirely.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Movies_Did_Jimmy_Karz_Star_In></span>What Movies Did Jimmy Karz Star In?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Jimmy Karz</a> took part in only a handful of projects before retiring from acting and the spotlight in 1998.&nbsp;Aside from “Matilda,” Karz appeared in “The Wedding Singer” as a boy Adam Sandler tagged the “Studliest Kid” at a bar mitzvah. He was also in the episode “Day for Knight” of “ER” in 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>Karz went on to work as a production associate for MTV News for two years. But one day, he realized he was more interested in service-oriented work.</p><p>He said: “I was really into community gardening at the time, and I began volunteering to teach people from low-income communities how to grow their food.”</p><p>Karz’s love for gardening would lead him down a different road, seeing him become a hero without a cape.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/karz-fotor-2023100613245.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Jimmy_Karz_a_Doctor_What_Is_He_Doing_Now></span>Is Jimmy Karz a Doctor? What Is He Doing Now?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Karz now leads a fulfilling life as a doctor. It all began when he picked up communal gardening after completing his undergraduate studies.&nbsp;The pastime led him to take an interest in biology and chemistry — two subjects that made him realize he wanted to delve more into science.</p><p>Karz returned to school to <a href=#>study</a> biochemistry, which led him to develop an interest in osteopathic medicine. By 2017, he had graduated from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and now works as a doctor.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jimmy_Karz_Weight_Loss></span>Jimmy Karz Weight Loss<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When he played Bruce Bogtrotter in “Matilda,” Jimmy Karz was a chubby kid. He has since lost a lot of that weight and now looks shredded. His weight loss journey was undoubtedly filled with obstacles. But the public will never know the intricacies because Karz did it all under the radar.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jimmy_Karzs_Net_Worth></span>Jimmy Karz’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2020, Karz’s net worth was estimated to be about $1.5 million. His fortune is most likely a culmination of his income as an actor and his annual salary as an osteopath, about $50k.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/reu-fotor-2023100613354.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jimmy_Karzs_Personal_Life></span>Jimmy Karz’s Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As far as we know, Jimmy Karz has no wife and never married. However, it is essential to note that Karz could simply be keeping his relationship from the limelight. After all, he cherishes his privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since he retired from acting, he has rarely made headlines, and very few photos of him have surfaced since he left for more fulfilling work.
