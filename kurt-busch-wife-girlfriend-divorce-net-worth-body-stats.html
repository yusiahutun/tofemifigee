Since he comes from a family that lives in the fast lane and on wheels, Kurt’s father and his brother Kyle Busch were also involved in NASCAR. He was able to make a name for himself as one of the most important people in this sport. Here are some things you should know about him.</p><h2><strong>Kurt Busch Biography</strong></h2><p>The racing driver was born as Kurt Thomas Busch on August 4, 1978, in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was raised by his parents, Thomas and Gaye Busch, together with a brother, Kyle Busch.</p><p>Since his childhood, Kurt has always been interested in car racing thanks to his father, who was also a racing driver. This sparked the interest of the young Kurt as well as that of his brother, who not only started driving but also served his older brother as a crew member.</p><p>He started with his father’s dwarf car and only won a competition on his second attempt as a teenager. Soon it was obvious that he was made for the sport, after winning 10 in a row in his first year as a young driver. Such a promise was enough for his father to dismiss his dwarf and give his son, who had turned 10, a powerful car to try.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kurt-Busch.jpg><p>For his education, Kurt Busch started at Durango High School, where he graduated, and then studied pharmacy at the University of Arizona, although it was clear that he should sit on his wheels.</p><p>Since starting at the age of 14, Kurt has come a long way, racing with several teams including Roush Racing (2000-2005), Penske Racing South (2006-2008), Penske Championship Racing (2009-2010), Penske Racing (2011), Phoenix Racing (2012), Furniture Row Racing (2012-2013) and Stewart-Haas Racing, where he has been a member since 2014.</p><p>As part of his achievements he won the Nextel Cup Series in 2004, Coca-Cola 600 and NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race in 2010, Budweiser Shootout in 2011, and Daytona 500 in 2017.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Coco Vandeweghe Married, Husband, Gay (Partner), Father, Family, Weight</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Busch, who has been on wheels for a very long time, has not only made a name for himself, but also a fortune. He was named one of the highest-paid Nascar drivers of 2013 by Forbes magazine. In the same year, he entered the 8th edition of the Nascar World Championship with earnings of $12 million and a salary and winnings of $9.6 million.</p><p>This means he now has a net income estimated at $50 million. That’s how much he has earned with his salary and profits and the many sponsorship deals he has signed. He is supported by brands like Mobile, Monster, Ford, Oakley, Rush Truck Centers, HAAS Automation, and State Waters Heaters. He also has other commitments that have increased his value.</p><h2><strong>Wife, Girlfriend, and Divorce</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_22997 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-22997></figure><p>The 2004 NASCAR Premier Series champion was not one without a colorful love story. He has had a number of relationships with different women in the past, although he is now married to Ashley Van Metre.</p><p>Before he entered into marriage, he had a relationship that could best be described as something straight out of the movies when he dated Patricia Driscoll, who he later claimed was a CIA agent and trained assassin. Patricia Driscoll and the NASCAR driver had had a relationship for a short time before things went wrong, and they parted with harsh feelings that led to the alleged CIA agent promising to destroy him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kurt-Busch-and-Patricia-Driscoll.jpg><p>Soon after the lawsuit, the “trained assassin” came out claiming that Bush had attacked her by grabbing her and banging her head against the wall. In denying the claim, Busch said that Patricia Driscoll was not only a trained assassin who had undercover operations in various parts of the world, including Africa and Central and South America, but he claimed that she once came home in a trench coat that covered a dress filled with bloodstains.</p><p>Even before meeting and dating Driscoll, Busch had a relationship with Eva Busch, who was the first friend known to have dated the NASCAR man. The two had been together since 2003, married in 2006, and divorced in 2011.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Sloane Stephens Boyfriend, Father, Mother (Sybil Smith), Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>The next woman to become his girlfriend and later wife is Ashley Van Metre, whom he married in the Caribbean in 2017.</p><h2><strong>Body Stats</strong></h2><p>Kurt Busch is a man who has a good physique and is rather athletically built. He is 5 feet and 11 inches tall and has a body weight of 150 pounds. His general body statistics have not been made publicly available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuLa%2B02aZrquTnXq4tcWeZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmnJmrvLOvxGalnqxdrLyzwMdmmaicqWLAta3TrGY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jasmine-tookes-interview.html>&#171;&nbsp;Model Jasmine Tookes' Beauty &amp;amp; Fashion Tips</a>
