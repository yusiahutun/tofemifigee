And this makes her portrayal in The Trial Of Christine Keeler, the BBC drama series about the Profumo scandal, which got under way on Sunday, all the more intriguing.</p><img id=i-ea87cc4d23b0a2b1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/30/21/22813678-7838345-image-a-71_1577741419342.jpg height=461 width=306 alt="Profumo had an&nbsp;affair with 19-year-old Christine Keeler (pictured)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Profumo had an&nbsp;affair with 19-year-old Christine Keeler (pictured)&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The producers have promised to tell the story through 'a female gaze', with Hobson appearing in every one of the six episodes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So what might we learn about the woman who was at the centre of one of the greatest political scandals of all time, but remains a footnote in history? Born in 1917, she grew up in Hampshire, one of two daughters of a penniless Royal Navy captain whose addictions to alcohol and gambling saw the family frequently impoverished.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her mother, who took a job in a hat shop to make ends meet, faced the ignominy of seeing her jewellery sold to pay off her husband's debts. For many years they had no home of their own, staying in the spare rooms of various relatives, or as paying guests in lodging houses.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Money was certainly something Valerie never had to worry about once she married the fifth Baron Profumo — a Harrow-educated war hero and multi-millionaire whose family had made its immense fortune as the owner of the Provident Life Insurance company.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They met thanks to her childhood ambition to follow a career in showbusiness. The young Valerie was adamant that her future would be on screen and, despite her father's varying fortunes, she persuaded her parents to send her to dancing classes in London twice a week.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Later, she went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and from there followed a film career which saw her appear in some of the best-loved British movies of the Forties, including Kind Hearts And Coronets with Alec Guinness and Blanche Fury with Stewart Granger.</p><img id=i-ea494e6b601b5436 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/30/22/22813674-7838345-Ben_Miles_left_and_Emilia_Fox_right_playing_Profumo_and_Valerie_-a-78_1577743323071.jpg height=815 width=634 alt="Ben Miles (left) and Emilia Fox (right) playing Profumo and Valerie in the TV adaption&nbsp;The Trial Of Christine Keeler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>&nbsp;Ben Miles (left) and Emilia Fox (right) playing Profumo and Valerie in the TV adaption&nbsp;The Trial Of Christine Keeler</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her greatest success would be as the grown-up Estella in David Lean's 1946 classic, Great Expectations, with the director assuring her that her glacial beauty made her exactly the right woman for the part.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Estella is a woman without a heart: dead, unable to feel,' he said. But off-screen, Valerie Hobson was clearly very capable of emotion.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1939, then aged 21, she had married Sir Anthony Havelock-Allan, the heir to the baronetcy of Lucknow and a distinguished film producer who was 14 years her senior and would later have such classics as This Happy Breed, Blithe Spirit and Brief Encounter to his credit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An insight into the extraordinary course of their marriage was given by the Mail's Michael Thornton, who in 2006 reported on having seen a remarkably frank and, to this day still unpublished, manuscript written by Sir Anthony.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In it, he described the moment a doctor told them that their first child, Simon, who was born in 1944, had Down's syndrome.</p><img id=i-d27084046ab2f648 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/30/22/22815246-7838345-image-a-82_1577744035691.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Ben Miles and Sophie Cookson playing Profumo and Christine in&nbsp;The Trial of Christine Keeler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Ben Miles and Sophie Cookson playing Profumo and Christine in&nbsp;The Trial of Christine Keeler</p><img id=i-bea6574246a2ae17 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/29/20/22775180-7835213-image-m-55_1577653037898.jpg height=533 width=634 alt="The Trial Of Christine Keeler (BBC1) is based on facts behind the Profumo Scandal of the early Sixties.

She is supposed to have said: 'Oh darling, we must go home now just as soon as we can and face up to it.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Yet shortly afterwards, with the scandal about to break, Anthony Havelock-Allan claimed that she called him in the middle of the night, 'distraught and desperate' and with an astonishing proposal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If you will agree to remarry me, I will leave Jack and divorce him,' she said. But Havelock-Allan gently turned down her suggestion and added some advice.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If you walk out, it won't give you any credit and people will think it's rather a betrayal — but if you stick by him, people will say what a wonderful woman.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In PR terms, it made excellent sense, with Valerie emerging as the very stoic heroine of the saga. Yet there can be no doubt that it was at the expense of her own happiness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Two years later, the Profumos moved to a countryside retreat in Hertfordshire, where, according to their son David's memoirs, 'a shadow fell' on Valerie's spirits as her husband spent long hours in London, devoting himself to volunteering at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity for the homeless.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'No longer a star and now denied the subsequent glamour of the political stage, she had lost her audiences . . . and her husband was again so busy that she was left to her own devices,' he wrote.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She had not perhaps envisaged how often his work would make him late back from London, or require him to spend the night in town; the occasional notes from an anonymous well-wisher claiming that he was seeing a girl in the East End did not help the situation, either.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As her son describes, Valerie found comfort from time to time in visits from Anthony Havelock-Allan, who had ended his career on a high with the 1970 film Ryan's Daughter and was living with a wealthy American woman. By then, Sir Anthony was in his 70s and Valerie in her late 50s and, although David Profumo does not spell out what happened during those visits, it was sufficient to make him wonder 'how my father could put up with such a situation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The fact seems to be that he had no respect for Tony and never regarded him as any kind of lingering threat: he coolly tolerated his continuing presence in my mother's life only because contact with him diverted some of her pent-up emotional pressures.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In public, meanwhile, the Profumos maintained their appearance of togetherness. Although the espionage scandal had to some extent turned them into social pariahs, they continued to be guests of Winston Churchill's son Randolph and of the Queen Mother, and their star returned to the ascendant when Profumo was awarded the CBE for services to charity in 1975.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'At social occasions, Hobson, still every inch a star, would make an entrance, sweeping in ahead of her husband,' wrote Michael Thornton. 'Profumo followed meekly behind, looking for all the world like her butler.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If they seemed trapped together in a dysfunctional web of their own creation, it was not all pretence. Valerie, in a letter to her husband on their 15th wedding anniversary in 1969, gushed: 'Never once since I met you have I been bored; never once have I not wanted you. And never once, even for a moment, have I not loved you with all my heart.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Such sentiments were rather rebuffed when, towards the end of her life, she told a close friend: 'I never really loved Jack. I married him as a safe haven for myself and my children.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the truth is perhaps more clear in a letter, recently uncovered, that she wrote to her son David: 'People say you cannot truly love two men,' she said. 'But you can — and I have.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That was a secret she kept up right until her death in 1998, aged 81.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In convincing the world that she had always stood by her man, it seems Valerie pulled off perhaps her most demanding acting job of all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKEeX%2BXbGtuZ4aWuaa%2ByJ5kgaeSqLyvea2oq2appZ7BpnnSmqCnrJyueri1xZ5krJ2VorKlesetpKU%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./windows-remove-rav-antivirus.html>&#171;&nbsp;Did RAV Antivirus Suddenly Appear on Your Windows PC?
